733
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,294
The question is...

734
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,463
...whether or not this technique...

735
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,341
...really makes a man good.

736
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,469
Goodness comes from within.

737
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,845

739

What crime did you commit?

779
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,649
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

780
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,610
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

781
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,529
Fourteen years, sir.

01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:42,752
Fine.

790
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,462
We could still look at C-block.

791
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,798
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

794
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,470
...will be transformed
out of all recognition.

795
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,681
Thank you very much
for this chance.

796
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,767
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

797
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,562
- Shall we go to my office?
- Thank you.

798
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,110
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

799
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,653
Come in.

800
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,366
Sir! 655321 . Sir!

801
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:14,659
Very good, chief.

802
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,453
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

803
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:19,164
Full name and number
to the governor.

804
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,209
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

805
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,007
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

806
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,886
That was no less a personage
than the minister of the interior.

807
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,138
The new minister of the interior.

808
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,308
What they call a very new broom.

809
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,896
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

810
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,607
And orders are orders.

811
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:49,361
Though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

812
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,863
An eye for an eye, I say.

813
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:55,116
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

814
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:59,037
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans...

815
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,122
...not hit back also?

816
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,959
The new view is to say "no."

817
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,545
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

818
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,799
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

819
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,760
- Sir, I...
- Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

820
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,388
You are to be reformed.

821
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,766
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

822
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,559
You will be leaving here.

823
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:26,064
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

824
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,066
It's believed you'll be able...

825
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,318
...to leave state custody
in a fortnight.

826
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:32,404
I suppose that prospect
pleases you?

827
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,489
Answer the governor's question!

828
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,074
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

829
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,660
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

830
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:41,162
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

831
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,792
Sign this where it's marked.

832
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,006
Don't read it, sign it!

833
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:54,926
It says you're willing to have
your sentence commuted...

834
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:58,179
...to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

835
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,764
And this.

836
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,523
And another copy.

837
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,912
ALEX:
The next morning I was taken to...

838
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,831
...the Ludovico medical facility...

839
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,875
...outside the town center.

840
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,626
I felt a malenky bit sad...

841
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,795
...having to say goodbye
to the old Staja...

842
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,299
...as you will, when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.

843
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,342
Right, hold the prisoner.

844
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,476
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

845
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,519
I've got 655321...

846
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,440
...on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

847
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,359
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

848
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:54,903
I'm Dr. Alcot.

849
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,031
Dr. Alcot. Very good, sir.

850
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:06,664
- Are you prepared for the prisoner?
- Yes, of course.

851
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,919
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

852
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,213
There, sir.

853
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,101
And there, sir.

854
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:33,149
And there.

855
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,156
Here you go.

856
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,628
There you are.

857
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,674
Prison escort, move forward!

858
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,011
Halt!

859
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,807
Excuse me, sir.

860
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,608
Is that the officer that is
to take charge of the prisoner?

861
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,663
A word of advice, doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

862
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:32,458
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again...

863
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,879
...in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

864
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,799
We can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

865
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,802
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

866
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,105
- Morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, doctor.

867
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:56,441
BRANOM:
Good morning, Alex.

868
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,277
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

869
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,112
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day.

870
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:02,614
Indeed, it is.

871
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,449
May I take that?

872
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,622
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, fine.

873
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,833
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky...

874
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,418
...and begin your treatment.

875
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:19,172
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

876
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,967
ALEX: I realize that,
and I'm very grateful to all concerned.

877
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,470
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

878
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,055
ALEX:
I hope so, missus.

879
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,602
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

880
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,145
BRANOM:
Nothing of the sort.

881
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,315
- Vitamins will it be, then?
- Something like that.

882
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,150
You're undernourished.

883
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,778
So after each meal
we'll give you a shot.

884
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,488
Roll over on your right side.

885
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:46,574
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

886
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,504
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

887
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,465
It's quite simple, really.

888
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,842
We're going to show you some films.

889
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,387
You mean like
going to the pictures?

890
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:09,347
Something like that.

891
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,518
That's good. I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

892
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,022
ALEX:
And viddy films I would.

893
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,483
Where I was taken to, brothers...

894
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,860
...was like no cine
I ever viddied before.

895
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,405
I was bound up
in a straitjacket...

896
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,865
...and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest...

897
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,410
...with wires running away from it.

898
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,996
Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes...

899
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:36,708
...so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.

900
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:38,710
It seemed a bit crazy to me...

901
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:41,838
...but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.

902
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:45,425
If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight...

903
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:49,137
...I would put up with much
in the meantime, my brothers.

904
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,915
The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine...

905
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,084
...like it was done in Hollywood.

906
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:22,462
The sounds were real horrorshow.

907
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,923
You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.

908
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,426
You could even get
the breathing and panting...

909
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,679
...of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.

910
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,765
And then what do you know?

911
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,184
Soon our dear old friend...

912
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,436
...the red, red vino on tap...

913
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,771
...the same in all places...

914
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,481
...like it's put out
by the same firm...

915
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,691
...began to flow.

916
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:46,110
It was beautiful.

917
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,780
It's funny how the colors
of the real world...

918
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,990
...only seem really real...

919
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:53,451
...when you viddy them
on a screen.

920
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,831
Now, all the time
I was watching this...

921
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,334
...I was beginning
to get very aware...

922
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,795
...of, like, not feeling
all that well.

923
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:07,924
And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.

924
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:12,470
But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film...

925
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:15,431
...which jumped right away
on a young devotchka...

926
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,476
...who was being given
the old in-out, in-out...

927
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,479
...first by one malchick...

928
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,481
...then another.

929
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,109
Then another.

930
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,489
When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick...

931
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,243
...leering and smecking
and then going into it...

932
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,663
...I began to feel really sick.

933
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,833
But I could not shut me glazzies.

934
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:45,503
And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about...

935
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,755
...I still could not get out of...

936
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:50,675
...the line of fire
of this picture.

937
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,012
Get me up.

938
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,181
I'm going to be sick.

939
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,184
Get something for me to be sick in!

940
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,358
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject...

941
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,861
...to experience
a deathlike paralysis...

942
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:13,406
...together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

943
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:16,576
ALEX: I can't stand it anymore.
- One of our early test subjects...

944
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,661
...described it as being like death.

945
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,831
A sense of stifling or drowning.

946
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,209
And it is during this period,
we have found...

947
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:29,088
...the subject will make
his most rewarding associations...

948
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:33,092
...between his catastrophic
experience, environment...

I don't think so, Sir Leslie.

Then I leave you to it. Nurse.

You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

of the damned.

Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1714
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:07,655
I can tell you that I, and the
government of which I'm a member...

1715
02:09:07,865 --> 02:09:11,826
...are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

1716
02:09:12,035 --> 02:09:13,327
We tried to help you.

1717
02:09:13,537 --> 02:09:17,665
We followed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong.

1718
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,878
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

1719
02:09:22,546 --> 02:09:25,757
We want you to regard us
as friends.

1720
02:09:26,008 --> 02:09:27,216
We put you right.

1721
02:09:27,676 --> 02:09:29,552
You're getting
the best of treatment.

1722
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:32,054
We never wished you harm.

1723
02:09:32,347 --> 02:09:35,016
But there are some who did, and do.

1724
02:09:35,517 --> 02:09:38,186
And I think you know who those are.

1725
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:42,565
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

1726
02:09:42,858 --> 02:09:45,193
They would have been
glad to have you dead...

1727
02:09:45,402 --> 02:09:48,571
...for they thought they could then
blame it on the government.

1728
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:51,532
There is also a certain man...

1729
02:09:51,742 --> 02:09:54,243
...a writer of subversive
literature...

1730
02:09:54,536 --> 02:09:56,579
...who has been howling
for your blood.

1731
02:09:56,872 --> 02:10:00,249
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

1732
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:02,210
But you're safe from him now.

1733
02:10:02,503 --> 02:10:04,545
We put him away.

1734
02:10:06,423 --> 02:10:09,550
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

At least he believed
you had done wrong.

1736
02:10:12,763 --> 02:10:17,016
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible...

1737
02:10:17,226 --> 02:10:20,645
...for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1738
02:10:21,563 --> 02:10:22,605
He was a menace.

1739
02:10:22,898 --> 02:10:25,024
We put him away
for his own protection.

1740
02:10:25,234 --> 02:10:26,567
And also for yours.

1741
02:10:27,319 --> 02:10:28,736
Where is he now?

1742
02:10:28,946 --> 02:10:32,406
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

When you leave, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

A good job on a good salary.

1747
02:10:44,461 --> 02:10:46,170
What job and how much?

1748
02:10:47,089 --> 02:10:51,050
You'll have an interesting job at
a salary you regard as adequate.

1749
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,469
Not only for the job
you're going to do...

1750
02:10:53,762 --> 02:10:57,348
...and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered...

1751
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:01,269
...but also because
you are helping us.

1752
02:11:02,563 --> 02:11:04,105
Helping you?

1753

We always help our friends,
don't we?

It is no secret
that this government...

1755
02:11:16,451 --> 02:11:19,620
...has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

1756
02:11:19,872 --> 02:11:23,291
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

1757
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:26,210
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view...

1758
02:11:26,461 --> 02:11:27,879
...of what we tried to do.

1759
02:11:28,839 --> 02:11:32,133
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

1760
02:11:32,384 --> 02:11:34,135
And you, Alex...

1761
02:11:34,344 --> 02:11:36,178
If I may call you Alex...

1762
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:39,223
Certainly, sir.
What do they call you at home?

02:11:43,312 --> 02:11:45,146
As I was saying, Alex...

1766
02:11:45,397 --> 02:11:50,318
...you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

1767
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:55,531
Do you understand, Alex?

1768
02:11:56,491 --> 02:11:58,659
Do I make myself clear?

1769
02:12:01,663 --> 02:12:03,915
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

1770
02:12:04,499 --> 02:12:07,835
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

I have arranged a little
surprise for you.

1775

Surprise?

1776
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:21,849
One that I hope

How shall we put it?

As a symbol of
our new understanding.

1780
02:12:30,150 --> 02:12:33,402
An understanding
