1
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,149
In May 1980, Fidel Castro opened
the harbor at Mariel, Cuba,

2
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,984
with the apparent intention
of letting some of his people

3
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,107
join their relatives
in the United States.

4
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,342
Within seventy-two hours, 3,000
U.S. Boats were headed for Cuba.

5
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,547
It soon became evident that Castro
was forcing the boat owners

6
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,702
to carry back with them
not only their relatives

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,304
but the dregs of his jails.

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,427
Of the 125,000 refugees
that landed in Florida,

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,661
an estimated 25,000
had criminal records.

10
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,827
...they are unwilling to adapt
to the spirit of our revolution.

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,026
We don't want them!
We don't need them!

12
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,062
MARIEL HARBOUR, CUBA

13
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,748
What do you call yourself?

14
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,021
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?

15
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,302
Where'd you learn English, Tony?
In school.

16
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,550
And my father,
he was from the United States.

17
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,988
Just like you, you know?

18
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,189
He was a Yankee.

19
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,667
He used to take me a lot
to the movies.

20
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,785
I learned.

21
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,545
I watch the guys
like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney.

22
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,704
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.

23
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,180
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.

24
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,859
So where's your old man now?
He dead. He die.

25
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,066
Sometime. Somewhere.

26
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,266
Mother?
She dead, too.

27
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,382
What work you do in Cuba?
You know, things.

28
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,382
I was this, that.

29
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,749
Construction business.

30
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,348
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

31
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,468
Any family in the States?
Cousins, brother-in-law?

32
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,542
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

33
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,588
You ever been to jail, Tony?

34
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,219
Me? Jail? No way, no.

35
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,748
Been in a mental hospital?
Yeah. On the boat coming over.

36
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,022
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men?

37
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,624
<i>You like to dress up like a woman?</i>

38
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,658
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

39
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,900
Just answer the questions, Tony.

40
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,101
Okay. No.

41
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,259
<i>Fuck, no.</i>

42
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,981
Arrested for vagrancy? Marijuana?

43
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,629
Never, man.
Heroin?

44
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,065
Cocaine?
No.

45
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,947
Where'd you get the beauty
scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?

46
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,501
How am I gonna get a scar like that
eating pussy?

47
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,545
This was when I was a kid, you know?

48
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,662
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

49
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,899
And this?

50
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,059
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.

51
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,506
Sweetheart, my ass! We've
been seeing more and more of these.

52
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,139
<i>Some kind of code
these guys used in the can.</i>

53
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,619
<i>Pitchfork means an assassin
or something.</i>

54
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,143
<i>You want to tell us about it...</i>

55
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,063
<i>or you want to take a trip
to the detention centre?</i>

56
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,945
Okay, you got me.

57
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,785
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars. Big deal.

58
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,060
That's pretty funny, Tony.
That's true.

59
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,902
It was a Canadian tourist.

60
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,140
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

61
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,425
Come on!
So I fuck up!

62
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,707
Let me talk to this guy. Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.

63
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,064
You a Communist?

64
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,183
How'd you like it?

65
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,979
They tell you always what to do,
what to think, what to feel.

66
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,380
Do you want to be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?

67
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,502
I don't have to listen to this!

68
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,469
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?
You own nothing, you got nothing!

69
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,781
<i>Do you want a chivato
on every corner...</i>

70
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,303
watching everything you do?

71
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,982
Everything you say, man?

72
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,706
You know I eat octopus
three times a day?

73
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,065
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

74
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,347
I got fucking Russian shoes,
my feet's coming through.

75
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,349
How'd you like that?

76
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,424
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

77
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,741
<i>I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no puta or thief.</i>

78
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,420
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

79
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,589
I want my fucking human rights, now!

80
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,582
Like President Jimmy Carter says.
Okay?

81
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,628
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

82
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,383
- What do you say?
- I don't believe any of this shit!

83
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,509
They all sound alike to me.
That Castro is shitting all over us.

84
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,388
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.

85
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,461
Get him out of here.
Know something?

86
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,585
You can send me anywhere.

87
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,865
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.

88
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,828
There's nothing you can do to me
that Castro hasn't done...

89
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,184
Get him out of here!

90
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,581
So?
So?

91
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,901
What'd you tell them?

92
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,541
What you told me to tell them.
That we... I was in sanitation.

93
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,348
They didn't go for it.

94
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,660
- Sanitation?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,109
I told you to tell them you was
in a sanatarium, not sanitation.

96
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,829
- Sanatarium. Yeah.
- You didn't tell me that.

97
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,620
No, I told you to say you had TB
and you was in a sanatarium.

98
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,064
You was cured.

99
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,459
- When did you tell me that?
- You should've kept your mouth shut.

100
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,745
They'd think you was a horse
and let you out.

101
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,430
ONE MONTH LATER

102
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,067
Tony! Montana!

103
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,059
Tony Montana! Come here.

104
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,265
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you.

105
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,347
<i>Come on, man. It's important.</i>

106
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,261
So close, man.
Come on.

107
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,590
- I gotta talk to you.
- Where are you going?

108
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,820
- Leave him alone.
- I got better things to do.

109
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,026
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.

110
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,624
Are you ready for some good news?

111
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,748
Sure. What you got, man?

112
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,821
We can be outta this place
in 30 days.

113
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,300
Not only that, but we got
a green card and a job in Miami.

114
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,580
Now are we made or are we made, man?

115
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,986
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

116
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,630
- No, man, somebody else.
- You're kidding?

117
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,144
- No.
- You're not kidding?

118
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,228
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

119
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,425
Rebenga?

120
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,779
- I know that name.
- Yeah?

121
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,383
- He's political.
- Yeah.

122
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,106
Well, he's coming in here
today. Castro just sprung him.

123
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,900
<i>This guy was one of the top dogs
for Fidel in the early days.</i>

124
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,383
Castro felt he couldn't trust him
and threw him in jail.

125
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,668
<i>But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys to death.</i>

126
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,947
<i>One of the guy's brothers
is a rich guy in Miami now.</i>

127
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,429
<i>He wants the favor repaid.</i>

128
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,222
That's where we come in.

129
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,986
It's ugly, man.

130
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,979
Yeah.

131
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,299
You tell your guys in Miami,
your friend...

132
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,548
it'd be a pleasure.

133
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,020
I'd kill a Communist for fun...

134
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,385
but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

135
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,463
MIAMI, FLORIDA, AUGUST 11, 1980.
HUNDREDS OF CUBAN REFUGEES

136
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,229
BEGAN RIOTING THIS MORNING
AT A DETENTION CENTRE SITUATED

137
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,268
UNDER INTERSTATE 95 IN NORTH MIAMI,
BURNING TENTS AND ATTACKING

138
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,501
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALISATION
GUARDS WITH PIPES, STICKS AND ROCKS.

139
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,860
<i>Libertad! Libertad!</i>

140
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,309
Rebenga!

141
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,868
From a friend you fucked!

142
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,107
That face. That's nice.

143
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,068
- That doesn't look like me.
- That looks pretty, man.

144
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,379
Fuck!

145
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,263
Your big shot friend better
come up with something soon.

146
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,818
I didn't come to the U.S.
To break my fucking back.

147
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,219
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

148
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,304
Fucking thing!

149
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,665
I told you.

150
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,424
What's wrong?

151
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,299
Look at that one.

152
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,824
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

153
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,582
<i>Look at those titties.</i>

154
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,988
Look at that punk with her.

155
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,506
What's he got that I don't have?

156
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,587
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

157
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,020
I mean, look at the way he dresses.

158
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,500
Come on.
That's style, flash, pizzazz.

159
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,502
And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

160
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,784
Look at this.

161
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,144
Fucking onions.

162
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,548
They ought to be picking gold
from the street.

163
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,109
There's two guys
looking for you out there.

164
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,220
<i>That's him, man. That's El mono.
I told you.</i>

165
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,948
Don't stay too fucking long.

166
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,339
We've got a lot of work to do.

167
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,101
Waldo! Good to see you, man.

168
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,546
This is my friend, Tony Montana,
I've been telling you about.

169
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,861
<i>Tony, that's Omar Suarez,
and that's Waldo Rojas over there.</i>

170
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,663
I got something for you.

171
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,706
Yeah? What do we gotta do?

172
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,146
Gotta unload a boat. Marijuana.
45 tons. You get $500 each.

173
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,582
- $500? That's great.
- You gotta be kidding.

174
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,938
$500?

175
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,619
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

176
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,543
The going rate on a boat
is $1,000 a night.

177
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,619
You know that.

178
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,418
First you gotta work
your way up to $500.

179
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,944
What I did for you in Freedom Town,
what was that?

180
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,100
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

181
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,658
- That was something else.
- Shut up! Take it easy.

182
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,218
<i>What's with this dishwasher, chico?</i>

183
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,780
Don't he know we could've got any
space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?

184
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,145
- $50!
- Then why didn't you?

185
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,501
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher,
or I'll kick your monkey ass.

186
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,182
Who the fuck are you?

187
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,822
You can't do that, man!

188
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,105
The Colombians!

189
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,106
Okay, all right, big man!

190
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,580
You want to make some big bucks?
Let's see how tough you are.

191
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,986
You know something about cocaine?

192
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,862
You kidding me or what?

193
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,624
There's a bunch of Colombians
coming in Friday.

194
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,544
<i>New guys. They say they got
two keys for us, for openers.</i>

195
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,509
Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.

196
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,899
If it's what they say,
pay 'em and bring it back.

197
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,981
Do that, you get $5,000.

198
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,866
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?

199
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,220
You know how to handle
a machine gun?

200
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,346
Yeah, man. We were in the Army.

201
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,940
- You gonna need a couple other guys.
- That's no problem.

202
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,946
Be at Hector's Bodega
at noon Friday.

203
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,827
You get the buy money then.

204
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,868
If anything happens
to that buy money...

205
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,589
my boss will stick your heads
up your asses...

206
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,786
faster than a rabbit gets fucked!

207
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,269
I'm scared.

208
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,901
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.

209
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,982
- That was dumb.
- You worry too much.

210
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,469
You'll have a heart attack.

211
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,587
You act like that guy's
doing you a favor or something.

212
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,458
- What's this with the Colombians?
- What does it matter?

213
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,504
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

214
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,582
I don't like fucking Colombians,
okay?

215
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,143
What you guys doing?

216
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,186
There's a lot of dishes
to be washed.

217
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,942
Wash 'em yourself.

218
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,179
I retire!

219
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,660
What the fuck you gonna do now?

220
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,021
- Don't come back here!
- I gotta look after my investment!

221
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,307
Fuck you guys!
Close the shop!

222
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,950
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.

223
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,306
Are you fucking crazy?
She's 103 years old.

224
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,947
Not that one, man! That one!

225
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,986
Which one?
The young one.

226
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,743
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

227
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,746
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.

228
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,264
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

229
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,628
Just play it cool. Miami Beach.
Miami Beach, man!

230
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,620
The money stays in the trunk
till I come out.

231
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,144
You got it? Me, nobody else. Okay.

232
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,139
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

233
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,501
Room 9. You ready?
Sure thing.

234
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,425
Okay.
You mind leaving the door open?

235
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,580
So my brother-in-law sees
everything's okay.

236
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,581
Sure. No problem.

237
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,058
No problem.

238
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,148
Hello. This is Marta.

239
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,703
Marta, hello.

240
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,782
I am Hector.

241
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,749
And I am Tony.

242
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,299
So, Omar says you're okay.

243
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,019
Yeah? Good. Omar's okay.

244
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,185
Okay.

245
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,899
So, you got the money?

246
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,624
You got the stuff?

247
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,259
Sure I have the stuff,
but not right here with me now.

248
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,942
I got it close by.

249
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,299
I don't have the money either, man.

250
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,947
I have it close by, too.

251
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,945
Where?

252
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,859
In the car?

253
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,788
No, not in the car, man.
No?

254
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,308
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

255
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,899
Not far.

256
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,900
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?

257
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,869
Where you from, Tony?

258
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,147
What the fuck difference
does it make where I'm from?

259
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,909
Take it easy, man.

260
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,059
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

261
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,507
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

262
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,105
Okay?

263
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,188
What's the story?
Tony!

264
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,389
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

265
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,459
- You steal from me, you're dead.
- Yeah?

266
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,061
You want to give me the cash...

267
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,500
or do I kill your brother first...

268
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,823
before I kill you?

269
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,060
Why don't you try
sticking your head up your ass?

270
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,307
See if it fits.

271
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,265
Yeah? Okay.

272
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,782
<i>It's very important.
I understand.</i>

273
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,428
<i>Thank you.
You're welcome.</i>

274
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,387
<i>You forecasted an earthquake...</i>

275
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,665
<i>in the 3-to-4-point range
this morning.</i>

276
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,828
<i>We had an earthquake
in the 3-to-4-point range.</i>

277
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,901
<i>I'm impressed.
Thank you, sir.</i>

278
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,223
<i>However, isn't it
rather slender evidence...</i>

279
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,747
You have such beautiful skin.

280
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,940
I like the way you...

281
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,429
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do today, but...

282
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,979
<i>Antonio, mira!</i>

283
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,941
Watch what happens to your friend.

284
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,021
If you don't want this
to happen to you...

285
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,589
give me the money.

286
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,063
Come on, come on.

287
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,468
Now the leg.

288
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,666
Let's do it, man. Come on.

289
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,981
We're all gonna be all right.

290
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,507
<i>Okay, cara cicatriz.</i>

291
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,864
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

292
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,219
<i>Last chance, pendejo!</i>

293
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,098
Fuck you!

294
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,978
- You okay?
- Yeah, man. It went in and out.

295
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,781
Okay, take him out of here, quick!

296
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,701
<i>Chi Chi! Get the yeyo.</i>

297
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,504
- Your turn.
- I kill you!

298
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,819
Die!

299
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,385
Hurry up! Get in! Come on. Let's go!

300
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,143
<i>Close the door!</i>

301
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,346
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.

302
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,986
<i>Yeah, well,
I'll check it out right away.</i>

303
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,063
You do that, Omar. You do that.

304
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,785
<i>You still got the money?
Yeah.</i>

305
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,666
<i>And I got the yeyo.</i>

306
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,824
<i>You got the yeyo?
Yeah, right.</i>

307
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,301
<i>Bring it here.
Fuck you.</i>

308
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,665
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.

309
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,985
Not you, me.

310
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,349
Nice fucking guy.

311
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,826
Frank Lopez. Tony Montana.

312
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,107
Tony Montana.
Mr. Lopez. It's a real pleasure.

313
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,464
You can call me Frank.

314
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,064
<i>Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team.</i>

315
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,624
Even the fucking prosecutors
around town...

316
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,825
they all call me Frank.

317
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,502
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?

318
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,467
Manny Ribera.

319
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,105
- He caught one on the job.
- Went right through.

320
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,703
We heard about that.

321
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,862
Omar, he tells me great things
about you guys.

322
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,108
Well, Omar's okay.

323
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,227
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

324
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,825
- That Commie son of a bitch...
- You don't have to mention that.

325
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,788
- That was fun.
- That was fun?

326
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,304
- Damn right.
- That was fun.

327
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,262
Sometimes it's fun.

328
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,062
What do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum? What do you like?

329
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,142
Gin is fine. Want some? Two gins.

330
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,388
I need a guy with steel
in his balls, Tony.

331
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,860
A guy like you. And I need him
around me all the time.

332
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,181
<i>You, Tony, and your compadre here.</i>

333
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,583
Here's the stuff.

334
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,265
Two keys.

335
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,100
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.

336
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,022
My gift to you.

337
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,580
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.

338
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,861
If people would do business
the right way...

339
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,418
there'd be no fuck-ups like this.

340
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,944
Don't think
I don't appreciate the gesture.

341
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,828
<i>You're gonna find,
you stay loyal in this business...</i>

342
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,107
you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

343
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,107
And you'll find out
your biggest problem...

344
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,067
is not bringing in the stuff...

345
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,744
but what to do
with all the fucking cash!

346
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,621
I hope I have that problem someday.

347
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,462
You'll have that problem,
don't worry.

348
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,427
Sit down over here.

349
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,338
Where the hell's Elvira?
It's late. Go find her, will you?

350
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,228
Jesus! Fucking broad.

351
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,303
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half undressing.

352
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,826
Gotta get her in between.

353
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,660
She's coming.
Yeah.

354
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,384
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

355
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,301
That's the best time.

356
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,666
What are you guys doing tonight?

357
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,742
You wanna go to a nice restaurant
with me? You hungry?

358
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,859
I could eat a horse.

359
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,862
- Okay, they'll cook you a horse.
- I'll eat it.

360
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,784
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

361
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,145
It's nothing.
It went right through me.

362
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,219
It hit the wall.

363
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,505
I ran out of bullets
like an asshole.

364
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,900
<i>When I changed the clip,
a guy who I thought I killed...</i>

365
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,060
<i>wasn't dead and shot me.</i>

366
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,461
The guy was behind me. I killed him.

367
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,905
- How many bullets you catch?
- Bullets? One bullet.

368
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,218
Nine millimeter.

369
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,139
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It's 10:00. I'm starving.

370
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,347
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

371
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,942
Where you going? Come on.

372
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,182
<i>Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.</i>

373
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,706
Tony Montana. Elvira.

374
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,264
- Hello.
- Manny Ribera. Elvira.

375
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,979
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?

376
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,425
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

377
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,428
- Again?
- Again.

378
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,707
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted
to assassinate you...

379
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,940
you wouldn't be too hard to find.

380
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,067
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

381
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,021
I got nothing but friends!

382
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,864
You never know. Maybe the catcher
on your Little League team.

383
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,979
The catcher? That son of a bitch,
he didn't get a base hit all season.

384
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,423
<i>I should kill him!</i>

385
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,701
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

386
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,507
They got the biggest distribution
set-up from here to Houston...

387
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,785
Tucson, all down that way.

388
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,582
What do you think of that?

389
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,579
Look.

390
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,980
<i>You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.</i>

391
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,981
<i>El Gordo!</i>

392
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,823
<i>He's got more cash
than anybody in this place.</i>

393
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,418
<i>He's a real chazer!</i>

394
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,905
<i>You know what a chazer is?</i>

395
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,465
<i>No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a chazer?</i>

396
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,018
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."

397
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,706
A guy who wants more than he needs.
He don't fly straight no more.

398
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:07,944
So, it comes down to one thing,
Tony boy, and you never forget it.

399
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,940
Lesson Number 1:

400
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,069
Don't underestimate...

401
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,425
the other guy's greed!

402
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,019
Lesson Number 2:

403
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,066
Don't get high on your own supply.

404
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,267
That's right. Lesson Number 2:
Don't get high on your own supply.

405
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,784
'Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

406
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,907
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.

407
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,629
That is '64?
The best, Mr. Lopez.

408
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,020
Omar, you pour it, and you bring
another bottle right away, will you?

409
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,063
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

410
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,626
- That's pretty good.
- For a bunch of fucking grapes.

411
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,063
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

412
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,308
How you like it, Tony?

413
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,981
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?

414
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,504
- Like you say, man.
- That's good!

415
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,263
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.

416
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:24,148
I'm gonna get you $550 suits...

417
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,582
so you look real sharp.

418
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,620
'Cause I want you to work for me.

419
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,908
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

420
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,265
We are going to do...

421
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,739
something big next month.

422
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:45,386
We are running a string of mules
from Colombia.

423
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,226
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

424
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,419
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.

425
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,023
You want a cigar?

426
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,943
You wanna dance, Frank,
or sit here and have a heart attack?

427
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,742
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

428
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,827
Don't foam into the Dommie P.

429
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,059
How about you?

430
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,227
What? You want me to dance?

431
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,266
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony. You dance.

432
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,348
Go on. Have some fun.

433
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,422
What do you think of him?

434
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,701
I think he's a fucking peasant!

435
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,464
But you get a guy like that
on your side...

436
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,145
he breaks his back for you.

437
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,100
- What's your name?
- What?

438
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,738
What's your name? Elvira what?

439
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,105
- Hancock.
- What?

440
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,659
- Hancock!
- Hancock?

441
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,148
Sounds like a bird. Hancock.

442
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,903
Flying around.

443
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,224
Where you from?

444
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,066
- Baltimore.
- What?

445
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,982
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?

446
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,065
- Where's that?
- It doesn't really matter, okay?

447
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,658
I'm just trying to be friendly.

448
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,906
I don't need another friend...

449
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,220
especially one
who just got off a banana boat.

450
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,422
Banana boat?

451
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,105
Hold it. You got the wrong guy.
I don't come off no banana boat.

452
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,025
<i>You're thinking of someone else,
maybe.</i>

453
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,466
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

454
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,702
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

455
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,703
So take it easy. Don't talk crazy.
Sorry.

456
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:30,147
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

457
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,869
What is your problem, baby?

458
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,179
<i>You're good-looking.</i>

459
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,261
<i>You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs...</i>

460
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,705
a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

461
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,269
Only you got a look in your eye...

462
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,910
like you haven't been fucked
in a year!

463
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,382
Hey, José.

464
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,621
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

465
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,827
Now you're talking to me, baby.
That I like. Keep it coming.

466
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,902
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

467
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,024
Not yet,
but you gotta give me some time.

468
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,422
Even if I were blind, desperate...

469
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,740
starved and begging for it
on a desert island...

470
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,105
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

471
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,188
That chick he's with...

472
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,343
Yeah?
She likes me.

473
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,267
She likes you? How do you know?

474
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,699
I know.

475
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,107
<i>The eyes, chico. They never lie.</i>

476
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,184
- Are you serious?
- Serious? What do you think?

477
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,665
That's the boss's lady, okay?

478
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,868
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Fuck you, man. The boss's lady.

479
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,502
That guy's soft.

480
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,949
Look in his face.

481
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,384
<i>The booze and the concha
tell him what to do.</i>

482
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,140
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?

483
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,739
Just remember last year at this time
we were in a fucking cage, okay?

484
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,149
You remember.

485
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,822
I'd like to forget that.

486
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,946
- I say be happy with what you got.
- You be happy.

487
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,662
- Me, I want what's coming to me.
- What's coming to you?

488
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,107
<i>The world, chico...</i>

489
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,341
and everything in it.

490
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,747
THREE MONTHS LATER

491
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,989
This is paradise.

492
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,625
This is paradise, I'm telling you.

493
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,188
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

494
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,979
I should've come here 10 years ago.

495
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,743
I'd have been a millionaire
by this time.

496
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,583
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat...

497
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,979
my own car, my own golf course.

498
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,903
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

499
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,548
A line of blue jeans.

500
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,702
With my name written
on the back of chicks' asses.

501
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,345
How's that?

502
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,339
That sounds completely crazy to me.

503
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,343
Look at that. Look.

504
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,984
<i>You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.</i>

505
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,026
<i>We're missing the action.</i>

506
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,704
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

507
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,508
Get lost, greaseball!

508
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,262
- Look at that.
- Ice cream?

509
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,022
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?

510
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,182
- Girls like ice cream.
- Come on. That won't work.

511
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,147
You can't do it that way.

512
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,028
You know how you pick up chicks
in this country?

513
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,061
- What was that? What you just did?
- That's what you do.

514
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,861
- That's disgusting.
- Watch.

515
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,669
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

516
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,900
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.

517
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,860
Figures you wouldn't understand.

518
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:19,022
But the women in this country,
when you do that, they know.

519
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,943
- They know what?
- They understand. They go crazy.

520
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,265
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

521
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,420
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

522
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,704
Look at that.

523
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,663
She's looking at us.

524
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,786
- You think you can do it with her?
- I think I can.

525
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,549
- You want to try it with her?
- Why not?

526
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,901
- You gonna watch me?
- I'm looking at you. Go ahead.

527
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,548
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.

528
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,309
I'm with you, man.

529
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,383
I'm gonna get her.

530
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,380
Go ahead, Romeo! Do your thing.

531
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,219
- Just be quiet. Just hang back.
- Romeo!

532
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:12,424
You're looking very pretty today.
Yes, you. I've been watching you.

533
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,581
You want to see something funny?

534
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,706
Take a look over there.
See that man?

535
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,145
<i>Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.</i>

536
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,459
I gotta watch my friend.

537
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,110
He gonna stick his tongue out
to that girl.

538
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,549
Look at that.

539
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,579
You're sick!

540
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,786
You see what happened to him?

541
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,660
- If I wasn't a nice guy...
- She's too big for you.

542
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,628
Causing trouble like that, come on.

543
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,065
- Bitch! Lesbian!
- What I try to tell you?

544
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,503
What I try to tell you?

545
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,388
This country,
you gotta make the money first.

546
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,423
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

547
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,582
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

548
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,341
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

549
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,068
That's the one I rented.

550
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,140
No. That's her, man. There she is.

551
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,739
<i>About time.</i>

552
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,065
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

553
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,629
He told me to pick you up.

554
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,738
<i>He said he'd meet us
at the track later.</i>

555
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,781
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

556
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,423
In that thing? You must be kidding.

557
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,062
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

558
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,742
- I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
- Come on.

559
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:31,986
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

560
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,026
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

561
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,380
So, you like this better?

562
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:53,461
It's like one of them tigers
from India.

563
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,507
Crazy guy.
Know what he's been doing?

564
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,309
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

565
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,068
He says he's gonna buy one.

566
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,584
<i>You do that
and you won't have any friends left.</i>

567
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,742
Not that you have any now.
You'll like that tiger, man.

568
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,628
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

569
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,065
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

570
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,989
- How much?
- $43,000, fully equipped.

571
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,380
- That all?
- Machine-gun turrets are extra.

572
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,388
He's a funny guy. Come here, Manny.

573
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,539
Bullet-proof this, okay?

574
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,621
And this here and here.

575
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,024
<i>And the windows.</i>

576
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:38,861
- Get me a phone with a scrambler.
- A scrambler.

577
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,305
And a radio with scanners...

578
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,301
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

579
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,982
Don't forget the fog lights.

580
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,824
In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

581
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,668
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

582
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,305
I thought you were taking me
to Frank.

583
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,059
We got an hour. You hungry?

584
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,422
No, but I'm bored.

585
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,028
Well, that figures.

586
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,261
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

587
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:20,622
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

588
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,428
Good doing business with you.

589
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,939
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

590
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,703
Planning on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

591
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,940
Yeah. You know who?

592
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,668
What would Frank say?

593
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,588
I like Frank, you know?

594
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,862
Only I like you better.

595
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,620
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

596
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:16,746
Don't get confused, Tony.
I don't fuck around with the help.

597
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:27,665
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.

598
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:28,939
Shit.

599
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,222
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?

600
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,345
No!

601
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,626
Playtime is over, okay?

602
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,738
Mama?

603
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,178
Long time.

604
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,542
No postcards from jail?

605
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,065
Gina.

606
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,503
- Tony?
- Look at you.

607
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,789
You're beautiful.

608
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,109
- I didn't...
- Mama, look at those eyes.

609
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,466
Look at that. She looks like me.

610
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,943
You know the last time I saw you,
you was like that.

611
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,386
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

612
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,387
I got something for you.

613
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,062
It's no big deal.

614
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:42,305
I never thought I'd see you again,
you know?

615
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:44,426
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

616
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,989
Well, no.

617
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:54,825
- You look so good.
- Look, open that up. Open it.

618
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,665
- For me?
- I think so.

619
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,061
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

620
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,309
See what's written on the back?

621
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,664
On the back?

622
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,224
- Always.
- "Always." It's beautiful, Tony!

623
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,746
Mama is still working
in the factory...

624
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,866
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

625
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,908
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

626
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,789
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

627
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,384
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

628
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,462
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

629
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,701
- Then I'll be making enough money...
- Surprise!

630
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,909
All that's over, starting today.

631
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,299
Why?

632
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:44,861
My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor, and Mama...

633
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,779
she don't have to sew in no factory.

634
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,106
Your son made it, Mama.

635
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,744
He's a success.

636
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,179
That's why
I didn't come around before.

637
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,824
I want you to see
what a good boy I've been.

638
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,549
Here's $1,000.

639
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,703
For you, Mama.

640
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,346
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?

641
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,021
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

642
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,019
No?
No.

643
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,867
What are you doing now?

644
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,388
<i>Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?</i>

645
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:29,620
No! Things are different now.

646
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,429
I'm working
with an anti-Castro group.

647
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,348
I'm an organizer now.

648
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:36,625
I get a lot
of political contributions.

649
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,063
Sure you do.

650
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:46,268
A gun sticking in somebody's face
is how.

651
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,708
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

652
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,303
is animals like you
and the killings.

653
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:59,141
It's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

654
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:02,427
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

655
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,387
People who send their children
to school.

656
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,108
What are you saying?
That's your son...

657
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,148
Son? I wish I had one.

658
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:10,939
He's a bum.

659
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,749
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

660
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,388
Who do you think you are?

661
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,663
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

662
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:28,224
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

663
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,665
and think you can get my respect.

664
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,869
You think you can buy me
with jewellery?

665
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:37,386
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

666
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,859
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

667
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:43,909
- You don't know what you're saying.
- That's not the way I am, Antonio!

668
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,499
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!

669
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,905
You are not going to destroy her.

670
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,182
I don't need your money.

671
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,942
I work for my living.

672
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,938
I don't want you
in this house anymore!

673
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,267
I don't want you around Gina.

674
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,744
So come on. Get out!

675
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:21,704
And take this lousy money with you.
It stinks.

676
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,303
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody?

677
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,422
<i>I'm sorry, Tony.</i>

678
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,429
Okay, Mama.

679
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,983
No. Tony, wait a minute!

680
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,140
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!

681
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,426
No, Mama.
He's no good. Gina!

682
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,422
Tony, wait, please!

683
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:52,308
I'm sorry. I don't know.
Mama, ever since Papa left she's...

684
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,460
Forget Papa. We never had one.

685
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,104
I know you did some bad things
back then.

686
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,944
In the Army,
I know you got into some trouble.

687
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,702
The Communists...

688
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:03,781
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

689
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,589
- Mama doesn't understand that.
- I know.

690
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,618
I just... I don't know.

691
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,178
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

692
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:17,179
<i>It doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.</i>

693
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,262
You're my blood, always.

694
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,499
I know.

695
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,662
- Come on. I want you to take this.
- I gotta go back in.

696
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,344
- No, Tony. Please.
- You need this.

697
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,704
What will I tell her?

698
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,462
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

699
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,940
Don't tell her I gave it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

700
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:49,544
And listen, you go out yourself.

701
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,906
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

702
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,140
You gotta get some fun out of life.

703
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,949
You gonna beat yourself to death
at 19?

704
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,419
A pussycat like you? Come here.

705
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,467
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.

706
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:08,586
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

707
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,103
I'll talk to her.

708
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,303
I'll talk to you.

709
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,385
Let's go.

710
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,540
She's beautiful. How come you...

711
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:27,069
Stay away from her. You hear?

712
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,104
She's not for you.

713
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:42,978
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA

714
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,788
So, this and my other factory,
I can guarantee production...

715
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:01,783
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

716
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,380
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

717
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:07,746
Basically, what I'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

718
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,061
who can share the risk with me,
somebody who can guarantee...

719
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:15,189
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

720
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,707
That's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

721
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,980
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

722
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,028
- It would've been nice if he'd come.
- He would like to come...

723
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,501
but with his trial coming up,
it's hard to leave the country.

724
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,866
- So he sent you instead?
- Something like that.

725
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,100
We'll talk at my house, shall we?

726
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,986
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

727
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:04,545
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me...

728
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:05,858
every month of the year.

729
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,099
He picks it up here.

730
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,340
I can sell it to him
for as little as...

731
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,500
$7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

732
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:18,029
But then we got to take the risk
of moving it.

733
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,063
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

734
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:22,981
That means we have
to go to war with them.

735
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,107
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

736
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,387
Why don't we split the risk?

737
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:33,380
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama...

738
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,862
we take it from there.

739
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,386
Panama is risky. It costs me more.

740
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:47,063
Panama I can sell for $13,500 a key.

741
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,704
$13,500? What, are you nuts?

742
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,700
$13,500? We still
got to take that shit to Florida.

743
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:57,826
<i>Do you know
what that's like these days?</i>

744
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,901
You got the Navy everywhere.

745
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:04,222
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

746
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,947
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

747
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,819
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

748
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,548
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

749
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,149
Forget about $13,500.

750
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,189
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

751
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:29,506
Excuse me. One moment.

752
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:36,020
What the fuck's the matter with you?

753
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,702
Are you negotiating for Frank Lopez?

754
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,940
Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

755
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:42,942
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

756
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:46,229
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

757
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,823
We're doing this one deal.
That's it.

758
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,741
Fuck you. How's that?

759
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,508
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

760
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,269
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

761
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,148
That's it. Let it go at that.
Don't worry about it.

762
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:01,381
Your head's in the wrong place.
You must watch out for yourself.

763
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,619
<i>Why not talk to him?</i>

764
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,587
<i>You think he wants
to give you the money?</i>

765
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,069
Shut the fuck up.

766
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,141
I'm doing the talking here, not you.

767
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:11,464
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

768
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,781
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

769
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,269
<i>That's easier to watch.</i>

770
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:17,703
Close your mouth.

771
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:21,187
I can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

772
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,218
Just shut up.
I'm doing the talking here.

773
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,785
Now where were we?
Panama.

774
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,380
You're looking for a partner, right?

775
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,189
Something like that.

776
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:36,626
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

777
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:41,309
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

778
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,745
That's my limit. I got no right.

779
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:46,788
- Nobody got no right to negotiate...
- Let the man finish, okay?

780
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:49,464
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

781
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,461
You got no authority here.

782
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,223
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

783
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:58,144
- Frank is gonna love it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

784
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,546
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

785
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,469
No, it is all right.

786
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,107
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

787
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:12,939
Well, good.

788
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:17,222
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.

789
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:22,220
But as soon as I get back to Miami,
I will talk to Frank personally.

790
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:24,299
Good.

791
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,339
My associates can escort you
to my chopper...

792
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,068
<i>to take you to Santa Cruz.</i>

793
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:32,108
<i>I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.</i>

794
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,068
You'll be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

795
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:37,625
Good.

796
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,868
Good talking to you.

797
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,906
Why not leave your friend here?

798
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:48,663
While you're gone, he can tell me
how to run my business.

799
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,708
- I think Frank wants to see him.
- No, that's okay.

800
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:55,305
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.

801
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,429
I guess so.

802
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,302
Let's finish our lunch.

803
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:10,746
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

804
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,220
You got everything a man could want.

805
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:18,783
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

806
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:24,303
Unfortunately, I don't feel the same
about the rest of your organization.

807
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,860
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

808
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,819
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.

809
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:38,786
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...

810
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,985
<i>from several years ago in New York.</i>

811
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,146
He was an informer for the police.

812
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:09,343
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

813
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,509
<i>So how do I know
you're not a chivato, too, Tony?</i>

814
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,420
Let's get this straight now.

815
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:31,063
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

816
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:32,629
You got that?

817
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:37,179
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

818
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:40,541
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

819
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:44,144
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him...

820
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,663
I never trusted him.

821
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,781
For all I know, he had me set up...

822
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,145
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

823
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,539
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

824
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,905
You want to go on with me, say it.

825
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,629
You don't, then you make a move.

826
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,630
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana.

827
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,063
<i>But I say to myself...</i>

828
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,021
this Lopez, your boss...

829
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:13,783
<i>he had chivatos like that
working for him.</i>

830
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:16,228
His judgment stinks.

831
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,541
So I think to myself...

832
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:23,828
how many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

833
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:29,938
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.

834
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,943
Frank is smart, you know?

835
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:39,460
You can't blame him for that animal.

836
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:43,303
It's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

837
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:46,029
That could happen to anyone,
even you.

838
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:54,983
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank...

839
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:57,343
and work it out?

840
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,067
I'll fix things between us.

841
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:03,468
You got my word on that.

842
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,783
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out...

843
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,699
we do business together
for a long time.

844
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:13,904
Just remember...

845
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,940
I'll only tell you one time...

846
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,981
don't fuck me, Tony.

847
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,421
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

848
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,938
You what?

849
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,426
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million...

850
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:45,784
without even checking with me?

851
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,861
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

852
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,668
<i>- Coño. Take it easy.
- Coño, my ass!</i>

853
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,742
<i>At $10,500 a key. It's puro.</i>

854
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:56,460
You can't lose money. No way.

855
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,746
We make $75 million on this deal.

856
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,660
$75 million.

857
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,582
That is serious money.

858
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:09,622
What is Sosa going to do...

859
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,905
when I don't come up
with the first $5 million?

860
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,663
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

861
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,060
He'll send a hit squad up here!
There'll be a war in the street.

862
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:21,745
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

863
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:26,502
You short a couple of million,
I go on the street for you.

864
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:28,467
I make a couple of moves...

865
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,425
a million here, a million there,
you got it.

866
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:39,180
You've been making moves
on your own?

867
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,188
I got ears, you know? I hear things.

868
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:50,668
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

869
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,866
<i>What about Gomez?</i>

870
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:55,180
<i>What'll he do
when you start moving 2,000 keys...</i>

871
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:59,024
Fuck Gaspar Gomez
and fuck the Diaz brothers!

872
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,259
<i>Fuck 'em all!</i>

873
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,260
I'll bury those cockroaches!

874
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,468
What they ever do for us?

875
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:16,828
Look, Frank, the time has come.

876
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:19,862
We gotta expand.

877
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:23,383
The whole operation. Distribution.

878
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:27,542
New York, Chicago, LA.

879
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,903
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

880
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,342
We gotta think big now.

881
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:40,024
Think big.

882
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,428
<i>Like your friend Sosa.</i>

883
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:52,941
Let me tell you something
about that greaseball cocksucker.

884
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,938
He is a snake, that's what he is.

885
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:01,498
<i>You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.</i>

886
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:04,301
<i>You don't trust a guy like that.</i>

887
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,900
You want me to believe...

888
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:12,503
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

889
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:14,469
You bought that line?

890
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:18,429
<i>Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.</i>

891
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:22,708
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

892
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,025
Like what?

893
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,543
Like what?

894
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:33,146
You tell me, "Like what."

895
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:39,624
You calling me a liar, Frank?

896
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:42,302
That what you're calling me?

897
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:51,665
Let's just say I want things
to stay the way they are for now.

898
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,338
You stall your deal with Sosa.

899
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:00,218
Stall it?

900
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,909
Okay, boss.

901
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,539
Come on.

902
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,099
I am the boss.

903
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:14,739
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.

904
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:21,418
Remember I told you
when you started...

905
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,979
the guys who last
in this business...

906
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,946
are the guys who fly straight...

907
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:29,623
<i>low-key, quiet.</i>

908
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,826
<i>And the guys who want it all...</i>

909
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:36,661
<i>chicas, champagne, flash...</i>

910
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,949
they don't last.

911
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,618
You finished?

912
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:44,659
Can I go now?

913
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,708
Hi, there.

914
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,308
You just missed Frank.

915
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:20,419
Too bad.

916
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,701
Only I didn't come to see Frank.

917
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:28,988
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

918
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,938
Make an appointment.
That's okay.

919
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:35,022
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.

920
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:44,098
<i>So why don't we have
a couple of drinks...</i>

921
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:45,903
<i>act normal...</i>

922
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,822
<i>and just take it easy.</i>

923
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:52,461
<i>Come on. I like Scotch.</i>

924
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:00,301
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay. I won't bite you.

925
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,741
We're all normal here.

926
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:11,899
I heard you and Frank
aren't working together anymore.

927
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:13,544
That's right.

928
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:20,100
I think it's easier, don't you?

929
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,468
Makes things easier.

930
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:25,979
Thank you.

931
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,306
Here's to "the land of opportunity."

932
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:31,709
For you, maybe.

933
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,739
You like kids?

934
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:40,539
Kids?

935
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,300
Kids. You know, kids. Little kids.

936
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,026
Sure. Why not?

937
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,823
As long as there's a nurse.

938
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:51,743
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

939
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:57,589
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

940
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,786
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

941
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:04,709
Come here.

942
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:12,459
Sit here.

943
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:16,461
<i>I want to talk to you. Sit down.
I'm not gonna bite you.</i>

944
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,908
Okay, here's the story.

945
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:30,107
I come from the gutter. I know that.

946
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,982
I got no education...

947
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,309
but that's okay.

948
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:39,626
I know the street...

949
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:42,099
and I'm making
all the right connections.

950
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:46,580
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

951
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:49,341
I could go right to the top.

952
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,425
Anyway...

953
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,340
what I got to tell you is this:

954
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:58,909
I like you.

955
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,743
I liked you
the first time I laid eyes on you.

956
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:10,298
I said, "She's a tiger.

957
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,507
"She'll belong to me."

958
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,703
Anyway...

959
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:22,668
I want you to marry me.

960
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:28,428
I want you to be
the mother of my children.

961
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:34,062
Me? Marry you?

962
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,344
That's right.

963
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:41,542
What about Frank, Tony?

964
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:43,743
<i>What will you do about Frank?</i>

965
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:47,220
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

966
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,938
Just think about it, okay?

967
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,465
I want you to really think about it.

968
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:00,868
I'll go now. Take care.

969
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:10,782
All your enemies are gone.

970
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,698
- Mr. Montana. How are you?
- Hello.

971
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:24,027
What the fuck she doing here?

972
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:28,302
Come on, man. She's just
dancing. Come on. Take it easy.

973
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:44,380
- It's just a disco.
- Who's that guy she's with?

974
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,825
He's some guy who works
for Luco. He's nobody.

975
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:49,548
- He's harmless.
- Works for Luco?

976
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:51,985
Yeah. Forget him.

977
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:57,584
Hello, Tony. You remember me?

978
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:03,619
Bernstein. Mel Bernstein, right?

979
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:06,506
Chief Detective, Narcotics.

980
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:09,944
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

981
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,104
Talk?
What are we going to talk about?

982
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:16,508
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.

983
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:18,628
No, not lately.

984
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:22,305
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

985
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:25,427
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians
at the Sun Ray Motel?

986
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,986
Whoever's giving you
your information...

987
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:30,708
is taking you for a long ride.

988
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:34,505
Tony, baby, we gonna talk...

989
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:37,388
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls...

990
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:38,789
here and now?

991
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:45,943
Keep your eye on her.

992
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,429
I'll do that.
Okay.

993
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:52,021
- My office.
- Good.

994
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:02,940
<i>The word on the street is
you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.</i>

995
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:05,579
That means you're not
a small-time punk anymore...

996
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,467
you're public property now.

997
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:10,269
Supreme Court says
that your privacy can be invaded.

998
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:12,022
Okay. How much?

999
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:14,829
How much?

1000
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:17,865
There's an answer to that, too.

1001
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,509
<i>Here's how much.</i>

1002
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:27,938
Can you see it?

1003
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:31,707
- Big number.
- Yeah!

1004
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:34,668
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1005
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:36,748
You know how this works?

1006
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:39,943
No. You tell me.

1007
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:42,819
We tell you
who's moving against you...

1008
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:45,863
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

1009
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:49,907
Let's say that you got
a real problem making a collection.

1010
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:53,061
And then we step in for you.

1011
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,700
Got eight killers with badges
working for me.

1012
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:58,748
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.

1013
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,821
You feed me a bust now and then.

1014
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:04,307
<i>Some cowboy setting himself up
in business.</i>

1015
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,100
Small fry, you know?

1016
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,308
We like snacks.

1017
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:15,781
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?

1018
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:20,986
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

1019
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:24,588
How do I know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?

1020
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:28,709
Well, that's not my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.

1021
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:34,427
You think I want this conversation
going any farther than this table?

1022
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:37,987
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops.

1023
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,181
I don't want
to see them embarrassed.

1024
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:42,067
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

1025
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:44,744
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

1026
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,505
<i>You understand
what I'm talking about?</i>

1027
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,342
Thanks for the drink.

1028
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:05,509
By the way...

1029
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,421
I got a vacation coming up.

1030
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:11,019
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

1031
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:12,509
We've never been there.

1032
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:15,741
So throw in a couple
of round-trip tickets, first class.

1033
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:25,467
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

1034
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,379
Every day above ground
is a good day.

1035
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,506
- Hello.
- Hello.

1036
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,901
Yeah. Now that's the idea.

1037
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:47,702
Okay, Mel.

1038
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:51,781
You think about what I said?

1039
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:53,544
About the kids?

1040
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:59,222
- You know, you are really nuts.
- I'm nuts about you.

1041
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:02,305
Why don't you find your own girl?

1042
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:03,665
My own girl?
Yeah.

1043
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:06,662
That's what I'm doing.
Do it somewhere else.

1044
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,900
Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

1045
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:11,225
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

1046
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:12,459
Will you do something?

1047
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:15,189
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

1048
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:18,267
I'm giving you orders. Blow!

1049
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:21,905
Orders? You giving me orders?

1050
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,500
The only thing in this world...

1051
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:33,060
that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

1052
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,699
<i>Balls.</i>

1053
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,859
Let's go.

1054
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,419
Elvira.

1055
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:58,462
When you gonna learn?

1056
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:04,659
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

1057
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,341
That cocksucker.
What happened?

1058
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:12,905
- He put that prick Bernstein on me.
- Who? Lopez did?

1059
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:15,505
How do you know?

1060
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:17,865
Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?

1061
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:20,062
<i>He's fertilizer.</i>

1062
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,984
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

1063
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,622
I'll tell you what, man.

1064
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:30,543
<i>You know our little trip
we've been planning to New York?</i>

1065
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,302
<i>It might be a good time.</i>

1066
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,587
Wait. Where you going?

1067
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,982
Welcome to my private room.

1068
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,664
- Your private room.
- This is my private room.

1069
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:23,265
<i>I got a beautiful, nice,
white lounge chair for you.</i>

1070
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:30,465
<i>Gina, you taste so muy bueno.</i>

1071
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,501
What are you doing?
Shut up!

1072
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:41,105
We wasn't doing nothing!
Fernando, wait!

1073
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,749
Get out!

1074
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:46,749
Damn you!

1075
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:48,502
You think he's cute?

1076
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:50,945
I saw him putting his hand
all over your ass.

1077
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,827
My kid sister in a toilet.

1078
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:54,104
It's none of your business.

1079
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:56,499
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!

1080
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:58,820
Don't tell me what to do!
I'll tell you!

1081
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:00,821
Listen to me. Come here.

1082
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:06,858
I catch you here again, I'm gonna
wipe you all over the fucking place.

1083
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:10,023
Yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now. I want to see it.

1084
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:12,305
- I want to see it now, big shot.
- Don't push me.

1085
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:15,780
- I want to see it now!
- Don't push me! Get outta here!

1086
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:19,466
- Go outside.
- You got some nerve, Tony!

1087
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:22,464
You think you can
tell me what to do?

1088
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:25,428
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not a baby anymore.

1089
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:28,263
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

1090
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:31,308
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

1091
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:35,430
Fucking, man! Come on, man.

1092
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:41,898
What the fuck you want?
You want something?

1093
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:44,980
No. Don't touch me.

1094
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:48,662
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.

1095
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:52,459
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.

1096
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:55,385
<i>Another great night here
at the Babylon?</i>

1097
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,347
<i>Okay. All right!</i>

1098
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:00,104
<i>Do another gram,
you'll all be babbling on.</i>

1099
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:03,743
<i>Is that coke in your bra,
or are you just glad to see me?</i>

1100
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,786
<i>A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.</i>

1101
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:08,862
<i>I'm in a good mood. I was depressed
when I got up this morning.</i>

1102
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,748
<i>I had a dry dream,
but I'm better now.</i>

1103
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:28,620
<i>I do Laurel and Hardy
in Spanish, too.</i>

1104
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:33,186
<i>That's the height of culture,
I assure you.</i>

1105
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:36,580
<i>But my favorite Cuban of all time
has to be Ricky Ricardo.</i>

1106
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:38,826
<i>Mr. Babalu himself.</i>

1107
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:40,662
<i>He had the same problem
for 10 years.</i>

1108
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,310
<i>"Lucy, don't come down to the club."</i>

1109
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:16,902
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.

1110
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,981
All right? He cares about you.

1111
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:21,538
To him,
you're still his little sister.

1112
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:24,946
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

1113
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:26,509
I'm 20 years old now.

1114
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:29,343
- I'm not anybody's baby.
- You're so grown-up.

1115
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:35,301
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

1116
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:38,860
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing in his life.

1117
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:42,704
The only thing that's any good,
that's pure.

1118
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:46,388
Of course he doesn't want you
mixing with those people...

1119
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:47,789
growing up to be like him.

1120
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:52,227
He has this father thing for you.
Feels like he has to protect you.

1121
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,982
Protect me against what?

1122
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:57,740
Against guys like that asshole
you were dancing with tonight.

1123
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:01,743
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

1124
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:06,068
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?

1125
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,102
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.

1126
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:10,181
By taking her to the toilet
to make out?

1127
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:14,149
<i>You've been a great audience.
I got a special treat for you.</i>

1128
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:15,743
<i>Here's a guy I found in the jungle.</i>

1129
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:18,583
<i>From Caracas, Venezuela.
He's unlike anything you've seen.</i>

1130
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:22,140
<i>Give a warm Babylon welcome
to the one and only Octavio!</i>

1131
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:49,820
Look around. Go out with someone
who has something on the ball...

1132
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:52,504
- who's going somewhere in life.
- Like who?

1133
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:56,421
For instance, someone who's got
a real job, like a banker.

1134
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:59,263
Or, or a doctor, a lawyer...
What about you?

1135
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:04,627
- What are you talking about?
- Why don't you take me out?

1136
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:06,541
Are you crazy?

1137
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:08,541
I see the way you look at me,
Manolo.

1138
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,549
Do you think I'm blind? I see.
Come on.

1139
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:13,867
What?
Look, Gina...

1140
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:17,824
Tony and I are like brothers,
all right?

1141
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:19,748
You're his kid sister.

1142
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:21,422
- So what?
- That's where it ends.

1143
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:25,182
- That's where it stays.
- Are you afraid of Tony?

1144
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:29,426
- You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
- I'm not afraid of anybody!

1145
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,581
<i>That's not the point here!</i>

1146
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:46,307
It's not for me. Don't look at me.

1147
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:49,348
How do you know?
'Cause I'm not here.

1148
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:51,227
Really? Then where are you?

1149
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:55,589
Shit, you're weird.

1150
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:57,900
- I'm weird?
- Hello?

1151
01:28:57,990 --> 01:29:00,299
<i>Hello, Miriam?
Tony!</i>

1152
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:03,507
<i>Put Manny on, okay?
Okay. Just a second.</i>

1153
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,058
It's Tony.

1154
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:10,100
<i>What are you doing,
checking up on me?</i>

1155
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,942
Get your clothes on and meet me...

1156
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:14,146
in front of Lopez Motors
in 45 minutes.

1157
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:17,702
<i>What? What happened?
Nothing we can't face.</i>

1158
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:20,585
All right. I'll be there.

1159
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:23,184
<i>You're still on the phone. Let's go.</i>

1160
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:24,339
Take it easy, okay?

1161
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:27,183
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

1162
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,308
Nick?
Yeah, Tony.

1163
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:31,620
This is what
I want you to do for me:

1164
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:34,708
<i>You call Lopez.</i>

1165
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:38,739
<i>Call him at his office
at 3:00 sharp.</i>

1166
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:42,388
<i>And you tell him:</i>

1167
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:45,540
<i>"We fucked up, he got away."</i>

1168
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:48,624
Okay. Yeah.
Got it? What're you going to say?

1169
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:50,541
"We fucked up. He got away."

1170
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,907
What time?
3:00 sharp.

1171
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:58,749
So when are we gonna make
some money on this thing?

1172
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:01,663
<i>Six months to start
don't mean shit, Larry.</i>

1173
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,381
<i>I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet, anyway.</i>

1174
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:08,588
<i>So you owe me.</i>

1175
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:12,184
<i>Listen, go down
to the ball game tonight.</i>

1176
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:15,741
<i>I couldn't make it. I got things.
I'll tell you about them.</i>

1177
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:19,821
You're kidding? What was the score?
Three to two?

1178
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:22,344
Mel, guess what?

1179
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:24,182
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers...

1180
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:25,942
they won the division tonight.

1181
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:28,260
That's great. Congratulations.

1182
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:31,383
What'd you do, fix the umpire?

1183
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:36,618
Jesus Christ.

1184
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:40,301
<i>Tony, what happened to you?</i>

1185
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:45,863
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.

1186
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,901
Who the fuck did this?

1187
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:52,070
Hitters. I don't know.

1188
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:55,220
Somebody must've brought them in.

1189
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:57,542
I've never seen them before.

1190
01:30:57,950 --> 01:30:59,269
Hello, Mel.

1191
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,308
Got an answer to this, too?

1192
01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:06,586
There always is, Tony.
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.

1193
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,343
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.

1194
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:12,865
Maybe you're right, you know?

1195
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:19,147
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.

1196
01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:23,148
We'll return the favor for you,
in spades.

1197
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:25,869
I'll take care of this myself.

1198
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:33,301
What is the gun for, Tony?

1199
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:36,829
What, this? It's nothing.

1200
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:42,503
I'm... How do you say? Paranoid.

1201
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:58,068
You gonna answer, Frank?

1202
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:03,705
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

1203
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,547
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?

1204
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:12,305
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.

1205
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:21,099
Hello.

1206
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:30,940
It's all right. I'm gonna be home
in an hour. Don't worry.

1207
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:36,902
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

1208
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:40,500
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about...

1209
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,979
you fucking cockroach.

1210
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:45,908
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.

1211
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:48,146
<i>You know what a chazer is, Frank?</i>

1212
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:52,028
<i>That's a pig
that don't fly straight.</i>

1213
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,628
Neither do you, Frank.

1214
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:58,829
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?

1215
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:00,828
I brought you in.

1216
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:03,344
So we had a few differences,
no big deal.

1217
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:07,463
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

1218
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:09,586
I stayed loyal to you.

1219
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:15,146
I made what I could on the side,
but I never turned on you, Frank!

1220
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,779
Never!

1221
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:21,539
But you...

1222
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:29,307
a man who ain't got his word
is a cockroach.

1223
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:35,344
Mel. Do something, will you?

1224
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:42,110
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

1225
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,662
All right, Tony. I was the one.

1226
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:01,459
Please, give me a second chance.

1227
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:05,943
Will you do that? Please?

1228
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:14,060
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.

1229
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:17,826
<i>Okay? $10 million.</i>

1230
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:21,502
I got it in a vault
over there in Spain, Tony.

1231
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:25,981
We go over there,
we get on a plane, and it's yours.

1232
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:29,827
Okay? All of it. $10 million.

1233
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:31,785
<i>Okay, Tony?</i>

1234
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,024
Please, Tony?

1235
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:41,822
Elvira? You want Elvira?

1236
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:45,502
<i>You can have her. I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.</i>

1237
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:49,026
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.

1238
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:50,987
I never did nothing to nobody.

1239
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:53,948
No, you never did nothing to nobody.

1240
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:56,067
You had somebody else do it for you.

1241
01:34:56,150 --> 01:34:57,424
Tony, I'm begging you.

1242
01:34:57,510 --> 01:35:01,139
- Get up! Get up now!
- Jesus! No! God!

1243
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:09,465
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.

1244
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:13,669
I won't kill you.

1245
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:16,221
- Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.

1246
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:19,825
Thank you.
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!

1247
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:21,589
No! No!

1248
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:43,708
Every dog has his day, Mel?

1249
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:44,984
I told him...

1250
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:48,227
it didn't make any sense...

1251
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:51,985
clipping you when we had you
working for us. He wouldn't listen.

1252
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:56,425
<i>He got hot tonight about the broad.</i>

1253
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:59,869
He fucked up.

1254
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:04,185
You, too, Mel. You fucked up.

1255
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,942
Don't go too far, Tony.

1256
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:11,143
I'm not, Mel. You are.

1257
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:22,428
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!

1258
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:25,389
Whoever says you was one?

1259
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:26,949
Wait a minute!

1260
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:31,020
You let me go. I'll fix this up.

1261
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:35,463
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself...

1262
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:39,061
one of them first-class tickets
to the Resurrection.

1263
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:43,059
Fucking punk! Son of a bitch!

1264
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,423
- So long, Mel. Have a good trip.
- Fuck you!

1265
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:57,022
- Okay, come on.
- What about Ernie?

1266
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:08,302
You want a job, Ernie?

1267
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:14,787
- Sure, Tony.
- Okay, then you call me tomorrow.

1268
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:17,222
Man, you got a job!

1269
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:20,465
Tony! Thanks.

1270
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:56,382
God, what's happened?

1271
01:37:58,550 --> 01:37:59,903
Where's Frank?

1272
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:03,268
Where do you think?

1273
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:11,700
<i>Come on. Get your stuff.</i>

1274
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:13,669
<i>You're coming with me.</i>

1275
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:42,700
So you come to me
with some kind of thing. Okay.

1276
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:44,701
<i>You propose it, I talk to you.</i>

1277
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:48,301
<i>But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.</i>

1278
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:52,268
I'm bringing in twice as much
as I ever did before.

1279
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:55,701
We're doing $10 million,
$15 million a month. Come on.

1280
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,826
That's serious money.

1281
01:42:58,110 --> 01:42:59,828
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.

1282
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:00,899
No way.

1283
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:04,619
- That's crazy. We can't do that.
- Then that's too bad.

1284
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:08,061
- What am I gonna do?
- We're not a wholesale operation.

1285
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:11,506
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me...

1286
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:13,900
the harder it is for me to rinse.

1287
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:16,187
That's a problem. I didn't know.

1288
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:19,068
The fact is, I can't take any more
of your money...

1289
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:21,380
unless I raise the rates on you.

1290
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:24,702
- You gonna raise the...
- I gotta do it.

1291
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:25,905
The IRS is coming...

1292
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:28,550
Don't give me that shit! Let's talk.

1293
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:29,619
I'm talking.

1294
01:43:29,710 --> 01:43:32,099
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1295
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:34,624
- This is business talk.
- Let me explain something.

1296
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:37,065
The IRS is coming down heavy
on South Florida.

1297
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:39,459
<i>There was a Time Magazine story
that didn't help.</i>

1298
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,949
There's a recession.

1299
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:43,260
I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.

1300
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:45,659
- I got to do it, Tony.
- You'll learn from him.

1301
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:48,981
I got to go 10% on the first
$12 million in denominations of 20.

1302
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:50,981
<i>I'll go 8% on your $10 bills...</i>

1303
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:52,059
<i>6% on your fives.</i>

1304
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,868
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.

1305
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:57,340
- There's no place else to go.
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

1306
01:43:57,430 --> 01:44:00,149
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

1307
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:02,507
Once, maybe. Then what?

1308
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:05,865
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank...

1309
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:07,941
with 20 million
of your hard-earned dollars?

1310
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:09,782
Come on, Tony. Don't be a schmuck.

1311
01:44:10,150 --> 01:44:11,378
<i>Who else can you trust?</i>

1312
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:14,143
<i>That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.</i>

1313
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,422
Did you hear that guy?

1314
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:23,350
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1315
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:24,579
Stay with us.

1316
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:27,628
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1317
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:32,225
And I got to run.
I'm safe but poor.

1318
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:36,627
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.

1319
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:41,107
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

1320
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:44,739
I'll see you. Take care.
You, too.

1321
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:58,989
That prick!

1322
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:02,108
Fucking WASP whore.

1323
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:06,466
<i>Talking to me like I'm some maricón
who came over on a boat.</i>

1324
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:10,987
I tell you what. We don't need
that smiling motherfucker.

1325
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:14,426
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1326
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:18,538
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

1327
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:20,709
And he's connected.

1328
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:25,704
Fuck them. Mob guys. Guineas.

1329
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:28,629
I don't trust them.

1330
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:49,869
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

1331
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:53,780
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

1332
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:57,344
- Look at that.
- What?

1333
01:45:58,190 --> 01:45:59,748
That cable truck there.

1334
01:45:59,830 --> 01:46:02,628
<i>Since when does it take three days
to rig a cable?</i>

1335
01:46:04,830 --> 01:46:07,298
What? You been watching it
for three days?

1336
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:11,340
The thing has been there
for three days.

1337
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:13,148
What am I gonna do, not look at it?

1338
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:16,463
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- I don't know.

1339
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:19,821
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

1340
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:25,503
- Maybe. I'll check it out, okay?
- You check it out.

1341
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:28,946
Then we're gonna blow
that fucking truck back to Colombia!

1342
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:33,382
Come on. We're not the only dopers
living on the block.

1343
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,744
Okay? Remember that.

1344
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:37,708
That truck could be anybody
and anything.

1345
01:46:37,790 --> 01:46:39,109
<i>It could be a cable company...</i>

1346
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:41,420
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

1347
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:44,070
For someone who's in charge
of my security...

1348
01:46:44,470 --> 01:46:47,382
Here are the keys to the front door.

1349
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:49,267
Go down there. Give them the keys!

1350
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:50,988
I'm just trying to say something.

1351
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:53,982
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

1352
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:55,139
I don't give a fuck.

1353
01:46:55,230 --> 01:46:57,744
It's 12% of our adjusted gross.

1354
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:58,979
12% isn't peanuts.

1355
01:46:59,070 --> 01:47:00,185
I don't give a fuck!

1356
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:02,625
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

1357
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:04,985
- Okay? You worry about it.
- I am worried about it.

1358
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:07,709
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1359
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:11,626
Our thinking, our fucking attitude,
you know?

1360
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:13,548
We're not fucking hungry anymore.

1361
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:16,145
<i>Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.</i>

1362
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:18,061
<i>New construction. New jobs.</i>

1363
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:20,989
<i>Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.</i>

1364
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:23,584
<i>We've put your money to work
for 75 years...</i>

1365
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,626
<i>building a more prosperous Miami.</i>

1366
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:27,986
<i>Count on us being here tomorrow.</i>

1367
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:31,107
That's because for 75 years
you been fucking everybody.

1368
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:34,905
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

1369
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:37,698
I mean, charging me 10 points
on my money.

1370
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:41,419
They're getting away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1371
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:42,909
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.

1372
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:46,903
They been around 1,000 years.
They got all the angles figured out.

1373
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:50,268
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

1374
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:52,426
True capitalist if ever I met one.

1375
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:55,902
Did you hear that?

1376
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:59,061
How would you know, bubblehead?

1377
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:02,218
You ever do nothing
besides get your hair fixed...

1378
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:03,504
and powder your nose?

1379
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:06,104
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

1380
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:08,226
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1381
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:12,060
- You should know that, Tony.
- I should know what?

1382
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:14,703
What should I know?

1383
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:17,344
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time?

1384
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:20,228
- Like I got to know something.
- Let me talk to you.

1385
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:21,989
Listen.
What time is it?

1386
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:23,298
This Seidelbaum.

1387
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:24,664
6:55.

1388
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:27,105
Okay.
I met with this Seidelbaum...

1389
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:30,500
<i>The drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...</i>

1390
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:33,145
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1391
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:37,018
<i>With a small law-enforcement
budget, how can you put a dent...</i>

1392
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:41,741
<i>on an estimated
$100-billion-a-year business?</i>

1393
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:44,227
<i>It seems at times all you can do...</i>

1394
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:46,266
<i>is put your finger in the dike
and pray.</i>

1395
01:48:46,350 --> 01:48:48,102
Put your fingers in a dyke?

1396
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:50,580
<i>The only place
you can get your fingers...</i>

1397
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:51,989
is in some dyke.

1398
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:57,386
<i>Not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.</i>

1399
01:48:57,710 --> 01:49:02,625
<i>These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.</i>

1400
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:05,340
<i>I am not one of those voices.</i>

1401
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:07,068
I know that. But you know why?

1402
01:49:07,150 --> 01:49:09,869
<i>'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.</i>

1403
01:49:09,950 --> 01:49:12,180
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1404
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:15,228
<i>... splendor of our city
at its best.</i>

1405
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:17,102
It's those guys, man!

1406
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:19,260
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians...

1407
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:21,500
they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

1408
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:24,866
<i>So they can make the fucking money,
and then get the fucking votes!</i>

1409
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:28,022
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1410
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:30,107
They fuck anything and anyone.

1411
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:33,148
Can't you stop saying "fuck"
all the time?

1412
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:35,870
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1413
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:39,829
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1414
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:41,463
You're boring.

1415
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:45,027
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

1416
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:48,148
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

1417
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:50,790
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

1418
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:57,345
That's 'cause he was so smart.

1419
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:05,902
You know what you're becoming?

1420
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:09,266
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1421
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:12,581
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

1422
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:14,103
<i>Get out of the way of the TV!</i>

1423
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:16,829
Dig a hole in the yard,
bury it, and forget about it.

1424
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:20,187
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1425
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:27,704
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

1426
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:31,706
Know what your problem is, pussycat?

1427
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:33,303
What is my problem?

1428
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:36,419
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1429
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:40,149
Why don't you get a job
or something?

1430
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:42,461
Do something. Be a nurse.

1431
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,023
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

1432
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:50,985
Anything beats lying around all day
waiting for me to fuck you!

1433
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:53,979
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1434
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:56,106
No? Frank was better?

1435
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:58,783
You're an asshole!

1436
01:50:59,630 --> 01:51:01,507
Where you going? Come here!

1437
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:04,300
Elvie!

1438
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:06,264
I was kidding!

1439
01:51:07,190 --> 01:51:08,782
I was only kidding!

1440
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:13,309
I guess sometimes married life
is not all it's cracked up to be.

1441
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:15,984
- Where you going?
- I got a date.

1442
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:18,388
You got a date? Come here.

1443
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:25,983
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.

1444
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:28,583
Yeah, it's all set up.

1445
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:30,861
Yeah, well, you forget it.

1446
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:32,861
<i>Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.</i>

1447
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:35,589
Stay out of it? It's my deal.
I set it up.

1448
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:38,145
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1449
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:40,539
<i>You like the ladies
more than the money.</i>

1450
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:41,619
That's your problem.

1451
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:44,508
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1452
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:46,899
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing...

1453
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:48,469
who're you gonna trust?

1454
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:49,744
Junior partner.

1455
01:51:51,150 --> 01:51:52,185
Bullshit, man.

1456
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:54,545
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.

1457
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:57,585
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

1458
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:59,308
You are an asshole, man!

1459
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:02,460
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

1460
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:05,029
Fuck you, man!

1461
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:09,426
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1462
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:12,666
Who do I trust? Me!

1463
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,147
Fuck him. "Trust."

1464
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:20,902
Asshole. Fuck called me an asshole.

1465
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:23,103
I need that shit.

1466
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:26,149
I don't need him.

1467
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:30,785
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1468
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:34,298
Back then I worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1469
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:37,063
<i>I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?</i>

1470
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:40,740
You saw me with Marlon Brando?
You know, we're good friends.

1471
01:52:40,830 --> 01:52:43,139
- I was his driver.
- No shit?

1472
01:52:43,230 --> 01:52:46,779
- Brando.
- They shot it there. Cartagena.

1473
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:49,347
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

1474
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:50,499
Italian guy.

1475
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:54,139
- Tell me about him.
- I also know Paul Newman.

1476
01:52:54,550 --> 01:52:56,586
- I worked with him in Tucson.
- No kidding?

1477
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:58,581
Do you know Benny Alvarez?

1478
01:52:58,710 --> 01:53:01,065
In Tucson. Benny Alvarez?

1479
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:04,024
- Subtotal.
- No?

1480
01:53:06,630 --> 01:53:07,983
He's a nice guy.

1481
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:12,384
$283,107.65.

1482
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:16,981
You want a company cheque here?

1483
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:22,178
I got $284,600.

1484
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:25,586
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.

1485
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:31,100
- Let's count it again.
- No. Come on.

1486
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:34,421
Business is business. Come on.
You're talking $1,500 here.

1487
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:38,462
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

1488
01:53:40,150 --> 01:53:42,345
- I'll count it again for you.
- No, come on.

1489
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:45,103
This cheque here,
where does this check go?

1490
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:50,779
- Montana Realty Company.
- Montana what?

1491
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:52,782
Montana Realty Company.

1492
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:56,459
Montana Realty Company.

1493
01:53:56,710 --> 01:54:00,180
That's $284,000.
$284,600.

1494
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:03,544
How come you don't know
Benny Alvarez?

1495
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:07,908
Me and Benny have lunch together.
He probably knows me.

1496
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:09,909
<i>You ask him.</i>

1497
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:28,703
We're up to what?

1498
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:36,026
Seven cheques. $1,325,623.

1499
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:40,701
$200,000 more.

1500
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:42,906
- We ought to take a leak.
- Freeze!

1501
01:54:42,990 --> 01:54:44,264
Get your hands up!

1502
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:45,863
Go against the wall, turn around.

1503
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:46,939
You're not kidding.

1504
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:50,102
You're under arrest
for violation of the RICO Statute.

1505
01:54:50,190 --> 01:54:51,782
"You have the right
to remain silent.

1506
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:54,338
"Anything you say
can and will be taken against you."

1507
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:57,740
How do I know you guys are cops?
What's that say, asshole?

1508
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:02,028
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1509
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:05,347
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!

1510
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:07,500
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.

1511
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:10,907
I want to call my lawyer.
Lot of good he'll do.

1512
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:13,220
You see that eye there in the clock?

1513
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:15,427
<i>Say, "Hi, honey."</i>

1514
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:18,379
<i>That's pretty cute. Look at that.</i>

1515
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:20,586
<i>You jerk off in front of us,
Seidelbaum?</i>

1516
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:22,900
<i>I was supposed to meet this
chick at 3:00.</i>

1517
01:55:22,990 --> 01:55:24,742
<i>You're a fucking pain in the ass.</i>

1518
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:26,788
<i>All right, Benny, kill it.</i>

1519
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:30,178
You understand the rights
I've given you?

1520
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:32,420
I know all that bullshit,
Seidelbaum!

1521
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:33,829
Save your breath.

1522
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:36,749
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

1523
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:39,460
I'm changing dollar bills,
that's all.

1524
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:43,061
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

1525
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:47,459
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer...

1526
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:51,665
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

1527
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:54,584
So dress warm.

1528
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:02,424
Give me a cheque
for $100,000, plus $300,000 in cash.

1529
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:05,624
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

1530
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:09,348
They're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion...

1531
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:12,108
and they'll get it.

1532
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:18,100
So, what am I looking at here?

1533
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,426
Five years. You'll be out in three.

1534
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:25,070
<i>Maybe less, if I can make a deal.</i>

1535
01:56:26,630 --> 01:56:28,109
Three fucking years!

1536
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:31,618
For what?

1537
01:56:32,630 --> 01:56:35,986
Washing money? The fucking country
was built on washed money.

1538
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:37,389
Can't be that bad.

1539
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:39,825
- It's not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?

1540
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:42,982
- The jails are like hotels.
- You kidding me or what?

1541
01:56:43,070 --> 01:56:45,789
You fucking high?
I'll delay the trial.

1542
01:56:46,030 --> 01:56:48,988
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1543
01:56:49,070 --> 01:56:50,185
Fuck you, man!

1544
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:52,181
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

1545
01:56:52,270 --> 01:56:54,022
<i>No way. I been there.</i>

1546
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:00,749
Okay, look.

1547
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:07,023
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

1548
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:10,507
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

1549
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:16,340
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1550
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:21,263
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.
But when you got $1,300,000...

1551
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:24,462
undeclared
staring into a videotape camera...

1552
01:57:25,110 --> 01:57:28,944
honey baby, it's hard to convince
a jury you found it in a taxicab.

1553
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:54,024
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

1554
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:55,179
I really appreciate it.

1555
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:56,908
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?

1556
01:57:57,190 --> 01:58:00,148
- Great. How's your wife?
- Three more months.

1557
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:02,619
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- How about you?

1558
01:58:02,710 --> 01:58:05,304
When you gonna have another Tony
to take your place?

1559
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:08,268
- I'm working on it.
- You have to work harder. Come.

1560
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:10,705
<i>I want you to meet
some of my friends.</i>

1561
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:16,658
This is Pedro Quinn...

1562
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:18,661
chairman of
the Andes Sugar Corporation.

1563
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:21,139
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

1564
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:24,461
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

1565
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:27,059
Pleasure.

1566
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:29,106
This is Ariel Bleyer...

1567
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:32,063
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

1568
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:37,904
And here is our friend
Charles Goodson from Washington.

1569
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:40,704
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Montana?

1570
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:43,143
Sit here, Tony.

1571
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,978
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

1572
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:53,581
I would like to discuss something...

1573
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:55,581
that is of interest
to all of us here.

1574
01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:58,502
You have a problem, Tony.

1575
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:02,382
We have a problem.

1576
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:06,149
I think together
we can solve all our problems.

1577
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:10,744
<i>We all know you have tax troubles
in your country...</i>

1578
01:59:10,830 --> 01:59:13,424
<i>and that you may have to do
a little time.</i>

1579
01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:15,543
<i>We have friends in Washington...</i>

1580
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:18,588
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

1581
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:22,060
You may have to pay some back taxes,
a big fine...

1582
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:24,821
but there will be no prison.

1583
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:26,459
Okay.

1584
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:29,227
So what's your problem, Alex?

1585
01:59:30,230 --> 01:59:31,948
I'll show you my problem.

1586
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:34,142
<i>I've heard about financial...</i>

1587
01:59:34,230 --> 01:59:35,504
<i>support the government receives...</i>

1588
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:37,342
<i>from the drug industry in Bolivia.</i>

1589
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:40,581
<i>Well, the irony of this
is that this money...</i>

1590
01:59:40,670 --> 01:59:42,149
<i>which is in the billions...</i>

1591
01:59:42,350 --> 01:59:44,022
<i>is coming from your country.</i>

1592
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:47,785
<i>You are the major purchaser
of our national product...</i>

1593
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:49,588
<i>which is cocaine.</i>

1594
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:51,820
<i>You're saying
the U.S. Government...</i>

1595
01:59:51,910 --> 01:59:56,028
<i>is spending millions to eliminate
the flow of drugs onto our streets.</i>

1596
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:57,868
<i>At the same time...</i>

1597
01:59:57,950 --> 02:00:00,703
<i>we are doing business
with the same government...</i>

1598
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:03,344
<i>that is flooding our streets
with cocaine.</i>

1599
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:06,138
<i>Let me show you
a few of the other characters...</i>

1600
02:00:06,230 --> 02:00:08,380
<i>that are involved
in this tragic comedy.</i>

1601
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:13,544
<i>My organization just recently traced
a large purchase by this man.</i>

1602
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:17,626
<i>This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.</i>

1603
02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:21,027
<i>He is the Minister of the Defense
of Bolivia, my country.</i>

1604
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:23,819
<i>And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago...</i>

1605
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:28,108
<i>bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

1606
02:00:28,190 --> 02:00:31,387
<i>Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be
the Bolivian Defense Minister...</i>

1607
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:33,620
<i>what is he doing
living in Switzerland?</i>

1608
02:00:33,710 --> 02:00:35,143
<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

1609
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:40,342
<i>This man here, Alejandro Sosa,
a very interesting character.</i>

1610
02:00:40,590 --> 02:00:42,182
<i>He's a wealthy landowner...</i>

1611
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:44,738
<i>educated in England,
very good family.</i>

1612
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:48,864
<i>But this man is the business brain
and drug overlord...</i>

1613
02:00:49,110 --> 02:00:51,749
<i>of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.</i>

1614
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:54,264
<i>He's not your ordinary drug dealer.</i>

1615
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:57,344
<i>Well, discussing it openly...</i>

1616
02:00:58,430 --> 02:01:00,785
<i>He's scheduled for 60 Minutes next.</i>

1617
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:06,663
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1618
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:10,028
People everywhere
are starting to listen to him.

1619
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:12,108
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1620
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:16,425
That is our problem.

1621
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:21,100
You remember Alberto, don't you?

1622
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:24,028
How could I forget him?

1623
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:27,941
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

1624
02:01:28,910 --> 02:01:31,185
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

1625
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:34,787
But he doesn't speak English.

1626
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:38,388
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1627
02:01:38,630 --> 02:01:40,507
He needs a little help.

1628
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:44,461
Is that a problem, Tony?

1629
02:01:50,150 --> 02:01:51,708
No problem.

1630
02:01:54,150 --> 02:01:55,219
Good.

1631
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:13,664
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

1632
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:16,908
You gonna tell me what happened
with Sosa, or what?

1633
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:20,267
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

1634
02:02:21,150 --> 02:02:22,265
Politics.

1635
02:02:26,830 --> 02:02:29,981
I want you to stay down here
for a while.

1636
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:32,788
Run things for me.

1637
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:35,580
I gotta go to New York next week.

1638
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:42,898
Fuck this, man.

1639
02:02:42,990 --> 02:02:45,788
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

1640
02:02:45,870 --> 02:02:47,462
You don't like it?

1641
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:53,541
You got me into this mess
in the first place.

1642
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:57,179
With that fucking Seidelbaum,
that right?

1643
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:58,589
With Seidelbaum?

1644
02:02:58,670 --> 02:03:00,786
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

1645
02:03:00,870 --> 02:03:03,509
How do you connect those two?

1646
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:06,424
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

1647
02:03:06,510 --> 02:03:08,466
I'm not hungry.

1648
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:11,988
You're not hungry?
Do you know about the trial?

1649
02:03:12,150 --> 02:03:16,109
- What did you order it for, then?
- I lost my appetite.

1650
02:03:21,070 --> 02:03:24,699
Do you even know that Sheffield said
he can get you a postponement?

1651
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:35,783
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

1652
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:42,146
Eating, drinking...

1653
02:03:42,630 --> 02:03:44,700
fucking, sucking...

1654
02:03:44,790 --> 02:03:47,429
- Come on, man.
- Snorting?

1655
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:48,625
Then what?

1656
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:51,982
Tell me. Then what?

1657
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:57,222
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

1658
02:03:58,590 --> 02:04:01,229
You got tits, you need a bra.

1659
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:03,543
They got hair on them.

1660
02:04:04,710 --> 02:04:07,941
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it...

1661
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:09,986
and you're eating
this fucking shit...

1662
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:13,860
and you're looking like
these rich fucking mummies in here.

1663
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:16,664
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

1664
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:19,699
- Is this what it's all about?
- Forget it.

1665
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:22,748
This what I work for? Tell me.

1666
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:29,264
Look at that.

1667
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:31,584
A junkie.

1668
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:37,508
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

1669
02:04:38,630 --> 02:04:42,225
Sleeps all day
with them black shades on.

1670
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:46,424
- Wakes up with a Quaalude...
- Don't pick on her, man.

1671
02:04:46,510 --> 02:04:50,059
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

1672
02:04:51,670 --> 02:04:54,025
I can't even have a kid with her.

1673
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:56,704
Her womb is so polluted...

1674
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:59,668
I can't even have
a fucking little baby with her!

1675
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:01,980
You son of a bitch!

1676
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:04,462
You fuck!

1677
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:08,379
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!

1678
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:11,905
What makes you
so much better than me?

1679
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:13,584
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

1680
02:05:13,670 --> 02:05:17,106
You deal drugs and you kill people.
That's wonderful, Tony.

1681
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:20,025
Real contribution to human history.

1682
02:05:20,110 --> 02:05:22,829
- Go ahead. Tell everybody.
- You want a kid?

1683
02:05:22,910 --> 02:05:24,184
Tell the world.

1684
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:27,023
What kind of a father
would you make?

1685
02:05:28,350 --> 02:05:30,705
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?

1686
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:34,226
Are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?

1687
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:38,548
- You don't know how to be a husband!
- Sit down before I...

1688
02:05:38,630 --> 02:05:41,019
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs...

1689
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:42,702
hanging around all the time?

1690
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:46,659
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.

1691
02:05:48,110 --> 02:05:50,988
What kind of life is that?

1692
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:56,669
Can't you see...

1693
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:01,504
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

1694
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:04,580
<i>We're not winners, we're losers.</i>

1695
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:09,463
- Go home. You're stoned.
- I'm not stoned, you're stoned.

1696
02:06:09,710 --> 02:06:12,019
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1697
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:16,107
I'm not going home with you.

1698
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:19,541
I'm not going home with anybody.

1699
02:06:21,310 --> 02:06:22,789
I'm going home alone.

1700
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:29,504
I'm leaving you.

1701
02:06:31,910 --> 02:06:33,821
I don't need this shit anymore.

1702
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:37,268
Okay, but I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.

1703
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:39,466
Let her go.

1704
02:06:40,070 --> 02:06:42,789
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

1705
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:51,583
What're you looking at?

1706
02:06:58,270 --> 02:07:00,545
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.

1707
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:03,263
You know why?

1708
02:07:05,070 --> 02:07:08,187
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

1709
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:13,820
You need people like me.

1710
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:20,749
You need people like me...

1711
02:07:20,830 --> 02:07:23,424
so you can point
your fucking fingers...

1712
02:07:23,950 --> 02:07:26,180
and say, "That's the bad guy."

1713
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:30,145
So...

1714
02:07:31,070 --> 02:07:32,628
what does that make you?

1715
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,219
Good?

1716
02:07:36,990 --> 02:07:38,662
You're not good.

1717
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:42,621
You just know how to hide...

1718
02:07:44,270 --> 02:07:45,498
how to lie.

1719
02:07:48,070 --> 02:07:51,346
Me, I don't have that problem.

1720
02:07:52,990 --> 02:07:56,062
Me, I always tell the truth.

1721
02:07:57,710 --> 02:07:59,348
Even when I lie.

1722
02:08:08,150 --> 02:08:10,584
So say good night to the bad guy!

1723
02:08:11,190 --> 02:08:12,384
Come on.

1724
02:08:14,510 --> 02:08:17,263
The last time you gonna see
a bad guy like this again...

1725
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:18,669
let me tell you.

1726
02:08:19,830 --> 02:08:23,061
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.

1727
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:26,859
<i>There's a bad guy coming through!</i>

1728
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:29,182
<i>Better get out of his way!</i>

1729
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:36,303
NEW YORK CITY

1730
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:56,659
No. You tell Sheffield to keep
his nose out of it.

1731
02:09:56,870 --> 02:10:00,067
<i>There's gonna be no trial.
I got it all under control now.</i>

1732
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:02,461
<i>Just tell him to stay out of it!</i>

1733
02:10:02,990 --> 02:10:05,299
<i>Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?</i>

1734
02:10:08,550 --> 02:10:09,903
Yeah, all right.

1735
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:26,382
Tony, everything go okay?

1736
02:10:26,710 --> 02:10:28,428
Yeah, everything is roses.

1737
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:33,708
Ernie, what time do you got?

1738
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,538
- Ten to.
- Ten to.

1739
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:38,741
- Where is this guy?
- I gotta call Manny.

1740
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:40,899
Sit down.

1741
02:10:40,990 --> 02:10:42,503
You don't tell me what to do here!

1742
02:10:42,590 --> 02:10:44,740
He's coming out.
He's coming.

1743
02:10:46,030 --> 02:10:48,305
- I don't give a fuck.
- It's him, man.

1744
02:10:50,910 --> 02:10:53,504
We do it
in front of the United Nations.

1745
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:55,421
That's how they want it.

1746
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:57,626
I don't care where you blow him up.

1747
02:10:58,230 --> 02:10:59,663
<i>Tell me when, okay?</i>

1748
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:04,109
<i>You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.</i>

1749
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:11,425
I want you to stay thirty meters
behind the car, okay?

1750
02:11:12,270 --> 02:11:13,828
Thirty meters. No more.

1751
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:15,946
I heard you the first time.

1752
02:11:16,030 --> 02:11:17,827
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.

1753
02:11:18,990 --> 02:11:20,981
I told you thirty meters.

1754
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:24,100
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.

1755
02:11:26,630 --> 02:11:28,302
Look. Here he comes.

1756
02:11:31,110 --> 02:11:33,101
Where's he going?

1757
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:34,948
<i>What's he doing that way?</i>

1758
02:11:45,870 --> 02:11:47,462
What the fuck he doing?

1759
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:02,701
What the fuck is that? Come here.

1760
02:12:02,790 --> 02:12:04,781
You said she took the kids
in the other car!

1761
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:08,579
She did, every fucking day.
I don't know what's going on.

1762
02:12:10,710 --> 02:12:14,066
No fucking way.
No fucking way. That's it!

1763
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:16,704
Forget it!

1764
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:21,189
We kill this guy alone.
No wife, no kids.

1765
02:12:21,870 --> 02:12:26,148
No way. If Sosa says we do it now,
we do it now. Let's go.

1766
02:12:26,710 --> 02:12:28,587
This fucking guy.

1767
02:12:57,310 --> 02:13:00,029
Okay, just stay behind him.

1768
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:04,108
Slowly, slowly.

1769
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:05,823
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.

1770
02:13:06,990 --> 02:13:08,503
Okay. Easy.

1771
02:13:10,190 --> 02:13:14,069
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

1772
02:13:14,870 --> 02:13:16,383
<i>This is so fucking bad.</i>

1773
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:20,423
You're losing them. Look!
You're losing them!

1774
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:22,307
I see them, all right? I see them!

1775
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:25,705
Ten meters, ten meters!

1776
02:13:26,110 --> 02:13:27,907
Move it. Move it!

1777
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:29,628
Shut the fuck up, okay?

1778
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:45,185
You don't have the guts to look them
in the eye when you kill them.

1779
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:46,749
You gotta hide with that shit...

1780
02:13:46,830 --> 02:13:47,819
Shut your mouth.

1781
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:49,548
He's getting up. Let's do it.

1782
02:13:49,630 --> 02:13:51,188
Make you feel good?

1783
02:13:51,670 --> 02:13:54,548
Make you feel good to kill a mama
and her kids. Make you feel big.

1784
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:56,699
Shut your mouth!

1785
02:13:56,790 --> 02:13:58,189
Like you, big man! Fuck you!

1786
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:00,183
<i>What do you think I am?</i>

1787
02:14:00,270 --> 02:14:02,340
You think I kill two kids
and a woman?

1788
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:05,786
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!

1789
02:14:08,030 --> 02:14:09,907
You die, motherfucker!

1790
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:16,063
What do you think I am?

1791
02:14:16,150 --> 02:14:18,220
You think I'm a fucking worm
like you?

1792
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:21,900
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!

1793
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:24,305
I told you, no fucking kids!

1794
02:14:24,430 --> 02:14:28,389
No, but you wouldn't listen!
You stupid fuck! Look at you now.

1795
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:35,865
Nick, where the fuck you been?

1796
02:14:37,110 --> 02:14:38,463
<i>On a delivery?</i>

1797
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:41,147
Where the hell is Manny?

1798
02:14:41,230 --> 02:14:43,027
I been calling all over.
Where is he?

1799
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:45,419
I don't know, Tony.

1800
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:47,262
He's been gone
the last couple of days.

1801
02:14:47,350 --> 02:14:49,705
<i>He didn't say nothing.
He's gone? Where?</i>

1802
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:53,544
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

1803
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:55,900
You can't trust nobody anymore!

1804
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:59,266
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.

1805
02:14:59,350 --> 02:15:01,500
<i>He didn't say nothing.
He took off?</i>

1806
02:15:02,270 --> 02:15:05,501
<i>Are you all right?
No, I'm not! I'm pissed!</i>

1807
02:15:05,590 --> 02:15:06,705
When I get back there...

1808
02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:08,746
I'll kick some ass
all over the place!

1809
02:15:08,830 --> 02:15:11,549
<i>When you coming back?
I'm coming back tonight!</i>

1810
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:13,861
This fucking cocksucker.

1811
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:18,861
Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone.

1812
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:23,462
<i>Gone? Where?
She got to see you right away.</i>

1813
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:27,099
Tell her I'll call her tonight.

1814
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:30,347
Listen to me.
What about Elvie? She call?

1815
02:15:30,470 --> 02:15:32,665
<i>No.
No.</i>

1816
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:34,422
Okay, listen to me.

1817
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:36,740
If she calls,
just tell her I love her.

1818
02:15:36,830 --> 02:15:38,900
Okay? Just tell her that.

1819
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:03,502
You hear from Manny?
No.

1820
02:16:03,590 --> 02:16:05,387
Your mama called, she gotta see you.

1821
02:16:05,470 --> 02:16:09,429
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.

1822
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:12,183
Get him on the phone. Elvie call?
No.

1823
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:17,943
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

1824
02:16:18,030 --> 02:16:20,146
- I want him here now! Okay?
- Okay.

1825
02:16:20,230 --> 02:16:23,267
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

1826
02:16:37,350 --> 02:16:41,582
Yeah? Mama. Yeah, I know.

1827
02:16:42,470 --> 02:16:45,030
They told me.

1828
02:16:45,110 --> 02:16:46,987
Okay. I'm coming over.

1829
02:16:47,070 --> 02:16:49,789
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

1830
02:16:53,750 --> 02:16:55,627
Put it on the speaker.

1831
02:17:05,270 --> 02:17:07,306
<i>What happened, Tony?</i>

1832
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:11,028
<i>Alex, how you doing?
What happened?</i>

1833
02:17:11,350 --> 02:17:13,580
We had some problems.

1834
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:18,059
<i>Alex?
Tony, what happened?</i>

1835
02:17:21,430 --> 02:17:23,580
<i>We had a little problem.
I heard.</i>

1836
02:17:23,670 --> 02:17:24,785
How you hear that?

1837
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:26,940
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.

1838
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:29,863
He was not supposed to give
that speech.

1839
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:35,267
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

1840
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:37,500
I told him to do something,
he didn't listen...

1841
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:39,023
so I cancelled his contract.

1842
02:17:39,110 --> 02:17:41,465
My partners and I are pissed off.

1843
02:17:41,990 --> 02:17:43,708
That's okay. No big deal.

1844
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:46,822
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

1845
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:48,901
No, Tony, you can't do that.

1846
02:17:49,550 --> 02:17:52,428
They found what was under the car.

1847
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:55,830
Now our friend has got security
up the ass.

1848
02:17:56,110 --> 02:17:59,500
<i>The heat will come down hard
on my partners and me.</i>

1849
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:02,147
There's not gonna be a next time...

1850
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:05,779
<i>- you dumb cocksucker! You blew it!
- Take it easy when you talk to me.</i>

1851
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:10,540
I told you a long time ago,
you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!

1852
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:12,507
Who the fuck
you think you're talking to?

1853
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:13,739
<i>You want to fuck with...</i>

1854
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:17,106
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

1855
02:18:18,030 --> 02:18:21,420
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

1856
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:24,819
Alex, you there? Hey!

1857
02:18:24,950 --> 02:18:28,306
<i>He's not there. Cálmate, man.</i>

1858
02:18:29,630 --> 02:18:33,339
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

1859
02:18:33,590 --> 02:18:35,820
One night, I follow her in a taxi.

1860
02:18:35,910 --> 02:18:38,504
She goes to a fancy house
in Coconut Grove.

1861
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:41,228
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!

1862
02:18:41,310 --> 02:18:44,188
You were giving her the money!
You see what you do to her?

1863
02:18:44,270 --> 02:18:46,545
- I don't give her that much money.
- You did!

1864
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:49,622
- One time, $1,000 you gave her.
- Was a guy with her?

1865
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:52,187
I don't know.

1866
02:18:52,470 --> 02:18:54,586
There was this car in the driveway.

1867
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:56,342
I know if I go there,
she'll kill me.

1868
02:18:56,430 --> 02:18:59,069
- She's like you.
- Where's the place? Where is it?

1869
02:18:59,270 --> 02:19:02,148
400 something...

1870
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:03,345
Citrus Drive.

1871
02:19:03,430 --> 02:19:05,705
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.

1872
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:09,022
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

1873
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:10,862
<i>She says to me, "Mira, shut up!</i>

1874
02:19:10,950 --> 02:19:12,144
"Mind your own business."

1875
02:19:12,230 --> 02:19:14,027
Exactly like you do to me.

1876
02:19:14,110 --> 02:19:16,783
Ever since you came back,
she's been getting this way.

1877
02:19:16,910 --> 02:19:19,470
- I gotta go.
- Why do you have to hurt everything?

1878
02:19:19,550 --> 02:19:21,506
Why do you have to destroy...

1879
02:19:21,590 --> 02:19:23,785
everything that comes your way?

1880
02:19:27,670 --> 02:19:30,059
409 Citrus Drive.

1881
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:33,342
- Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.
- Fuck!

1882
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:36,423
Okay. Listen, boss, I'll try again.

1883
02:20:08,110 --> 02:20:11,227
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?

1884
02:22:05,870 --> 02:22:10,261
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.

1885
02:22:15,790 --> 02:22:17,223
Jesus, Tony.

1886
02:22:17,670 --> 02:22:20,980
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.

1887
02:22:21,510 --> 02:22:23,102
Go get Gina.

1888
02:22:30,990 --> 02:22:32,059
No!

1889
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:41,268
No, Gina. Come on, Gina. No!

1890
02:22:41,350 --> 02:22:42,908
God!

1891
02:22:50,910 --> 02:22:52,582
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.

1892
02:22:52,670 --> 02:22:54,501
We gotta get out of here.

1893
02:23:32,710 --> 02:23:34,063
Come on, Gina.

1894
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:39,660
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.

1895
02:23:39,790 --> 02:23:41,781
- You got her?
- I got her.

1896
02:24:07,990 --> 02:24:11,699
No! This is Tony's place! Let me go!

1897
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:57,668
We put some pills into her.
She's gonna be all right, Tony.

1898
02:24:57,750 --> 02:24:59,388
She's cooling down. Right?

1899
02:24:59,470 --> 02:25:02,303
- She's gonna be fine. Just fine.
- Right.

1900
02:25:04,830 --> 02:25:06,582
What are we gonna do now?

1901
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:12,019
Do?

1902
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:18,262
We're going to war.

1903
02:25:19,430 --> 02:25:21,500
<i>That's what we're gonna do.</i>

1904
02:25:24,910 --> 02:25:27,868
We're gonna eat that Sosa
for breakfast!

1905
02:25:30,110 --> 02:25:32,624
Close that fucker down.

1906
02:25:38,270 --> 02:25:40,226
Tony, take it easy.

1907
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:50,827
All right, Ernie. Let's go.
We'll take care of the house.

1908
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:00,747
Come on.

1909
02:27:00,830 --> 02:27:03,219
This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

1910
02:27:19,310 --> 02:27:22,108
Come on.
I'll bury these cocksuckers.

1911
02:27:30,670 --> 02:27:33,230
We gotta get organized here.

1912
02:27:43,950 --> 02:27:47,067
Fuck! Manny.

1913
02:27:53,590 --> 02:27:55,501
How the fuck I do that?

1914
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:01,779
How the fuck I do that, Manny?

1915
02:28:45,470 --> 02:28:46,459
Manolo.

1916
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:40,066
Is this what you want, Tony?

1917
02:29:50,790 --> 02:29:53,588
You can't stand for another man
to be touching me.

1918
02:29:55,910 --> 02:29:57,707
So you want me, Tony?

1919
02:30:01,310 --> 02:30:02,743
What are you talking about?

1920
02:30:04,310 --> 02:30:05,709
Is that it?

1921
02:30:09,430 --> 02:30:10,749
Here I am, Tony.

1922
02:30:15,510 --> 02:30:17,626
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?

1923
02:30:20,310 --> 02:30:21,868
I'm all yours now.

1924
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:26,620
You better come and get me now.

1925
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:29,341
Come on.
Come and get me.

1926
02:30:29,430 --> 02:30:30,829
Come and get me.

1927
02:30:31,790 --> 02:30:34,463
You do it now before it's too late.

1928
02:30:37,030 --> 02:30:38,179
Come on, Tony.

1929
02:30:40,270 --> 02:30:41,385
Fuck me.

1930
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:47,579
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!

1931
02:31:03,790 --> 02:31:04,779
Die!

1932
02:31:18,350 --> 02:31:20,944
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

1933
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:47,383
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

1934
02:32:04,230 --> 02:32:05,743
Please talk to me.

1935
02:32:07,510 --> 02:32:08,989
Don't be mad at me.

1936
02:32:09,230 --> 02:32:12,427
Please. Gina, come on.

1937
02:32:14,150 --> 02:32:17,665
I love Manny, you know?

1938
02:32:17,990 --> 02:32:19,184
I love him.

1939
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:23,539
And I love you, too, you know?

1940
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:50,418
Give me a smile.

1941
02:32:50,510 --> 02:32:54,628
They're coming from everywhere!
Open up! Open the fucking door!

1942
02:32:56,190 --> 02:32:58,101
<i>Please! Tony!</i>

1943
02:32:58,190 --> 02:33:00,101
<i>Let me in, boss! Please!</i>

1944
02:33:00,310 --> 02:33:02,266
<i>Tony, open the fucking door!</i>

1945
02:33:23,270 --> 02:33:28,185
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.

1946
02:33:31,550 --> 02:33:33,780
You wait for me. I'm coming back.

1947
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:39,819
Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?

1948
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:46,181
<i>You're fucking with the best!</i>

1949
02:33:50,390 --> 02:33:52,028
You want to fuck with me?

1950
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:55,468
You cockroaches.

1951
02:33:58,670 --> 02:34:01,309
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.

1952
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:07,468
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>

1953
02:34:08,910 --> 02:34:10,980
Say hello to my little friend!

1954
02:34:14,190 --> 02:34:15,703
<i>You want to play rough?</i>

1955
02:34:16,830 --> 02:34:19,549
<i>There! You like that?</i>

1956
02:34:21,350 --> 02:34:22,578
You want more?

1957
02:34:29,390 --> 02:34:30,539
<i>You whores!</i>

1958
02:34:31,910 --> 02:34:32,979
Cowards!

1959
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:20,103
Want to fuck with me?

1960
02:35:36,270 --> 02:35:37,942
<i>Go ahead!</i>

1961
02:35:39,350 --> 02:35:40,339
<i>Come on!</i>

1962
02:35:42,950 --> 02:35:45,020
How do you like that?

1963
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:47,667
<i>You fucking maricón!</i>

1964
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:51,628
You think you can take me?

1965
02:35:51,710 --> 02:35:53,860
<i>You need a fucking army
if you gonna take me!</i>

1966
02:35:53,950 --> 02:35:58,102
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!

1967
02:36:03,710 --> 02:36:06,782
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!

1968
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:10,138
You fuck with me,
you fucking with the best!

1969
02:36:14,190 --> 02:36:15,703
I'm still standing.

1970
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:22,219
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1971
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:25,581
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1972
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:27,342
You think you kill me with bullets?

1973
02:36:27,430 --> 02:36:29,990
I take your fucking bullets!
Go ahead!

1974
02:37:28,750 --> 02:37:33,744
